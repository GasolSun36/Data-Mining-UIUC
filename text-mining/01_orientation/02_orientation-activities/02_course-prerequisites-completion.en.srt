2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:12,454
This lecture is a brief
introduction to the course.

3
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:15,833
We'll then do cover
the objectives of the course.

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:19,754
The prerequisites and the course format,
the reference books and

5
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,280
how to complete the course.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,543
The objectives of the course
are the following.

7
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:28,967
First we would like to cover
the basic concepts and

8
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:31,990
practical techniques in text data mining.

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:40,139
So this means we will not be able to cover
some advance the techniques in detail but

10
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:45,702
rather we are going to choose
the practical useful techniques and

11
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:48,352
then treat them in more depth.

12
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:52,950
We are going to also cover the basic
concepts that are very useful for

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,870
many applications.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,802
The second objective is to cover more
general techniques for text data mining.

15
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:07,046
So we emphasise the coverage
of general techniques

16
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:11,989
that can be applicable to any
text in any natural language.

17
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:17,402
We also hope that these techniques
to either automatically

18
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:24,990
work on problems without any human effort
or only requiring minimum human effort.

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,500
So these criteria have helped us to choose

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,830
techniques that can be
applied to many applications.

21
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,620
This is in contrast to some
more detailed analysis of text

22
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,360
data particularly using natural
language processing techniques.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,570
Now, such techniques
are also very important.

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,940
And they are indeed necessary for
some of the protections

25
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,770
where we would like to go in depth to
understand the text data in more detail.

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,760
Such detailed understanding
techniques however are generally

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,410
not scalable and they tend to
require a lot of human effort.

28
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,275
So they cannot be easy to
applied into any domain.

29
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:20,176
So as you can imagine in practice it
would be beneficial to combine both

30
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:24,661
kinds of techniques using
the general techniques that we'll be

31
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,167
covering in this course as a basis.

32
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:32,556
And improve these techniques
by using more human effort

33
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:37,258
whenever it's appropriate
We also would like to

34
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:42,549
provide a hands on experience
to you in Macro aspects.

35
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:48,377
First, you can look at some experience
was using a text mining toolkit and

36
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,580
implementing text mining algorithms.

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:57,160
Second, you have the opportunity to
experiment with some algorithms for

38
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,570
text reminding and
physics to try them on some data sets and

39
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,450
to understand how to do experiments.

40
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,610
And finally you have
opportunity to participate in

41
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,030
a competition of a text-based
prediction task.

42
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,930
You are expected to know the basic concept
of computer science for example data

43
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:23,090
structures and some other really
basic concepts in computers science.

44
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,570
You are also expected to be
familiar with programming and

45
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,391
comfortable with programming,
particularly with C++.

46
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:36,300
This course however is
not about programming,

47
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,600
so you are not expected
to do a lot of coding.

48
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,980
but we're going to do give you a C++
toolkit that's fairly sophisticated so

49
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,240
you have to be comfortable
with handling such a toolkit.

50
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,330
And you may be asked to write
a small amount of code.

51
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,640
It's also useful if you
know some concepts and

52
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,670
techniques in probability and statistics,
but it is not necessary, knowing

53
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,260
such analogy will help you understand
some of the algorithm in more depth.

54
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,540
The format of the course is lectures plus

55
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,270
quizzes that will be given
to you in a regular basis.

56
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,960
And there is also an optional
programming assignment.

57
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,922
Now, we've made programming assignments
optional not because it's not important,

58
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:46,292
but because we suspect that not
all of you will have the need for

59
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:51,262
computing resources to do
the programming assignment.

60
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:52,083
So naturally,

61
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:56,420
we would encourage all of you to try
to do the programming assignment.

62
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,308
If possible as that would be a great
way to learn about the knowledge

63
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:04,600
that would teach in this course.

64
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:11,810
The main reference book for this course
is a recent book that Sean Massung and

65
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,970
I have co-authored.

66
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,471
The title is Text Data Management and

67
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:21,884
Analysis A practical introduction to
information retrieval and text mining.

68
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:26,627
However this reference book is not
required in the sense that if we follow

69
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,194
all the lecture videos closely then you

70
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:33,707
should have little problems because
working on the quiz problems and

71
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:36,993
will program your assignment
to pass the course.

72
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:41,337
However the book would be useful
to give you a high level and

73
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:48,370
systematic description of all the topics
covered in this course plus some others.

74
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,500
It would also help you understand
some topics in more depth.

75
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,020
So if you problems with following some of
the videos the book may be useful to you.

76
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,575
The book is also the reference book for
another book.

77
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:06,438
If you are interested in buying the book,
there's a link here.

78
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:11,901
And there should be substantial discount
for the students of this course.

79
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:17,184
There are also quite a few other
useful reference books and ratings.

80
00:06:17,184 --> 00:06:22,099
And they are available though
the link at the bottom of this slide.
