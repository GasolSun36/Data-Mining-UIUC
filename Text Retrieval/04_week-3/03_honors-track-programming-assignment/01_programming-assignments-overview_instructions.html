  Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  For the programming assignments, you are going to use
  <a href="https://meta-toolkit.github.io/meta/">
   MeTA
  </a>
  , a C++ data sciences toolkit that supports a variety of tasks such as text retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning. The main focus in this course will be on how to use and extend the text retrieval methods implemented in MeTA. The assignments assume a very basic understanding of C++ and elementary data structures. That being said, even if your experience is in languages other than C++, you are highly encouraged to go through the assignments, as the focus will be on exploring text retrieval concepts, not on testing your knowledge of the syntax.
 </p>
 <p>
  This assignment will explore the main text processing techniques implemented in MeTA and then guide you through implementing a major component of a search engine. It will also involve a competition where you can freely create and optimize your own search engine. Although the assignment starts in Week 3, we encourage you to install the toolkit as soon as possible.
