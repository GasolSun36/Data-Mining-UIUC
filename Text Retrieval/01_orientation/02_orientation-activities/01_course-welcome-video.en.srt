Hello,

2
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:12,786
welcome to the course in Text and
Retrieval and Search Engines.

3
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:14,131
I'm ChengXiang Zhia.

4
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:16,175
I have a nickname Cheng.

5
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:20,940
I'm a Professor of the Department of
Computer Science at the University of

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,141
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

7
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:26,993
This first lecture is basically
an introduction to the course,

8
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,433
a brief introduction to what
we will cover in the course.

9
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:34,887
We're going to first talk about the data
mining specialization seeing this course

10
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:36,679
is part of that specialization.

11
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,575
And then we will cover motivation
objectives of the course,

12
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:48,010
this will be followed by prerequisites and
course format and reference books.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,375
And then finally,
we will talk about the course schedule,

14
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:57,368
which has a number of topics to be
covered in the rest of this course.

15
00:00:57,368 --> 00:01:01,690
So the data mining specialization
offered by the University of Illinois at

16
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,150
Urbana-Champaign is really to address
the need for their mining techniques

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,320
to handle a lot of big data,
to turn the big data into knowledge.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,712
There are five lecture-based courses,

19
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:19,070
as you see on the slide,
plus one capstone project in the end.

20
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,867
I'm teaching two of them,
which is this course, Text Retrieval and

21
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:25,944
Search Engines, and this one.

22
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:30,542
The two courses that I cover
here are all about text data.

23
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:34,756
In contrast,
the other courses are covering more general

24
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:38,635
techniques that can be
applied to all kinds of data.

25
00:01:38,635 --> 00:01:42,817
So pattern discovery,
taught by Professor Jiawei Han, and

26
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:47,737
cluster analysis, again taught by him,
about the general data mining

27
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:52,089
techniques to handle structured and
unstructured text data.

28
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:57,723
And data visualization covered by
Professor John Hart, is about the general

29
00:01:57,723 --> 00:02:02,934
visualization techniques, again,
applicable to all kinds of data.

30
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:06,522
So the motivation for
this course, in fact, also for

31
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:11,465
the other courses that I'm teaching,
is that we have a lot of text data and

32
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,613
the data is everywhere,
is growing rapidly.

33
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:18,979
So you must have been
experiencing this growth.

34
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:24,027
Just think about how much text data
you're dealing with every day,

35
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:26,339
I list some date types here.

36
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:31,238
For example, on the Internet we see
a lot of web pages, news articles, etc.,

37
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,816
and then we have blog articles, emails,

38
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:36,301
scientific literature, and tweets.

39
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:40,681
As we are speaking, maybe a lot
of tweets are being written, and

40
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:42,802
a lot of emails are being sent.

41
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:48,699
So, the amount of text data is beyond
our capacity to understand, then.

42
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:52,609
Also, the amount of data makes it
possible to actually analyze the data to

43
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,512
discover interesting knowledge.

44
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:59,015
And that's what we meant by
harnessing big text data.

45
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:09,015
