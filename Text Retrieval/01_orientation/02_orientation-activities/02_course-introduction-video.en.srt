2
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,777
Text data is very special.

3
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:16,449
In contrast to the data captured
by machines such as sensors,

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,686
text data is produced by humans.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,490
And they also are meant
to be consumed by humans.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,159
And this has some
interesting consequences.

7
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:31,031
Because it is produced by humans, it tends
to have a lot of useful knowledge about

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,134
people's' preferences,
people's' opinions about everything.

9
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,138
And that makes it possible to mine

10
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,608
text data to discover those
latent prefaces of people,

11
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:45,979
which could be very useful to build
an intelligent system to help people.

12
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,081
You can think about
scientific literature or

13
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:53,353
so and it's a way to encode
our knowledge about the world.

14
00:00:53,353 --> 00:01:00,060
So it's very high quality content, yet we
have difficulty digesting all the content.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,398
Now as a result of the fact that
text is consumed by we humans,

16
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:10,136
we also need intelligent software tools
to help people digest the content, or

17
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,139
otherwise we'd miss
a lot of useful content.

18
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:19,245
This slide shows that the human really
plays important role in test data mining.

19
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,681
We have to consider human in the loop, and

20
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,484
we have to consider the fact that
the text is generated by human.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,390
So, here are some examples of
useful text information systems.

22
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,894
This is by no means a complete
list of all applications.

23
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,897
I categorize them into
different categories.

24
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:41,034
But you can probably imagine
other kinds of applications.

25
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,302
So let's take a look at some of them.

26
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,605
Search for example,
we all know search engines is special.

27
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,109
Web search engines, iPad,
all of you are using Google, or Bing, or

28
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,344
another web search engine all the time.

29
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,880
And we also have live research assistants.

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,884
And in fact, wherever you have a lot of
text data, you would have a search engine.

31
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,854
So for example, you might have
a search box on your laptop.

32
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,323
All right,
to search content on your computer.

33
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,260
So that's one kind of application systems,
but

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,029
we also have filtering systems or
recommended systems.

35
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,298
Those systems can push
information to users.

36
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,335
They can recommend useful
information to users.

37
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,938
So again, use filters, spam filters.

38
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,840
Literature the movie recommenders.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,210
Now not of them are necessary
recommending the information to you.

40
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,680
For example email filter,
spam email filter,

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,486
this is actually to filter out
the spams from your inbox, all right.

42
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:38,458
But in nature these are similar systems in
that they have to make a binary decision

43
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,562
regarding whether to retain
a particular document or discard it.

44
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,000
Another kind of systems
are categorization systems.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,371
So for example, in handling emails,

46
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:56,042
you might prefer automatic,
sorter that would automatically

47
00:02:56,042 --> 00:03:00,613
sort incoming emails into a proper
folders that you created.

48
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:07,153
Or we might want to categorize product
reviews into positive or negative.

49
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:11,424
News agencies might be interested in

50
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,094
categorizing news articles into
all kinds of subject categories.

51
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,063
Those are all categorization systems.

52
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,068
Finally there are also systems
that might do more analysis.

53
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:26,339
And oh, you can say mine text data.

54
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,908
And these can be text mining systems or

55
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,378
information extraction systems,
and they can be

56
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:37,317
used to analyze text data in more detail
to discover potentially useful knowledge.

57
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,920
For example companies might
be interested in discovering

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,358
major complaints from their customers
based on the email messages that the,

59
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,293
they have received from the customers.

60
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:52,465
All right, so
having a system to support that would

61
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:57,437
really help improve their productivity and
the customer relations.

62
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,842
Also in business, intelligence companies
are often interested in analyzing product

63
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,813
reviews to understand the relative
strengths of their own products

64
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,948
in comparison with competitors.

65
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,087
And, and so these are all examples
of these test mining systems.

66
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:19,692
[INAUDIBLE] we have a lot of data
in particular literature data.

67
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:23,296
So, there's also great opportunity
of using computer systems

68
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,633
to analyze the data to
automatically read literature, and

69
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,169
to gain knowledge, and
to help biologists make discoveries.

70
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,639
And you can imagine many others.

71
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,675
So the point is that with so
much text data,

72
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:41,714
we can build very useful systems to
help people in many different ways.

73
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,350
Now how do we build this systems?

74
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,522
Well these actually are the main
technologies that we'll be talking

75
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:54,060
about in this course and the other course
that I'm teaching for this specialization.

76
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,797
The main techniques for
building these systems and also for

77
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:02,402
harnessing the text data are text
retrieval and text data mining.

78
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:07,040
So I use this picture to show
the relation between these two

79
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,708
some of the different techniques.

80
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,444
We started with big text data, right?

81
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,248
But for any applications, we don't
necessarily need to use all the data.

82
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:22,355
Often we only need the small subset of the
most relevant data, and that's shown here.

83
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:28,828
So text retrieval is to convert big,
raw text data into that small

84
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:33,399
subset of most relevant data that are most
useful for a particular application.

85
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,201
And this is usually
done by search engines.

86
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,770
And so
this will be covered in this course.

87
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,874
After we have got a small
amount of relevant data,

88
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:46,512
we also need to further analyze the data
to help people digest the data, or

89
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,916
to turn the data into
actionable knowledge.

90
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,187
And this step is called text mining,
where we use a number of techniques to

91
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,790
mine the data to get useful knowledge or
pairings.

92
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,427
And the knowledge can then be used
in many different applications.

93
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:05,431
And this part, text mining, will be
covered in the other course that I'm

94
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,301
teaching called Text Mining and Analytics.

95
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,338
The emphasis of this course
is on basic concepts and

96
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,340
practical techniques in text retrieval.

97
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:19,011
More specifically we will
cover how search engines work.

98
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,214
How to implement a search engine.

99
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,150
How to evaluate a search engine, so
that you know one search engine is

100
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,220
better than another or
one method is better than another.

101
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,490
How to improve and
optimize a search engine system.

102
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,525
And how to build a recommender system.

103
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,164
We also hope to provide a hands on
experience on multiple aspects.

104
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:42,668
One is to create a test collection for
evaluating search engines.

105
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:48,107
This is very important for knowing
which technique actually worked well.

106
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,844
And whether your search engine system
is really good for your application.

107
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,784
The other aspect is to experiment
with search engine algorithms.

108
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,120
In practice, you will have to face
choices of different algorithms.

109
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,956
So it's important to know
how to compare them and

110
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:08,394
to figure out how they work or
maybe potentially, how to improve them.

111
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:15,067
And finally, we'll provide a platform for
you to do search engine competition.

112
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:19,872
Where you can compare your different
ideas to see which idea works better

113
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,607
on some data set.

114
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,311
The prerequisites for
this course are minimum.

115
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,514
Basically we hope you have some basic
concepts of computer science, for

116
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,249
example data structures.

117
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:34,153
And we hope you will be comfortable
with programming, especially in C++.

118
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:38,658
because that's the language that we'll use
for some of the programming assignments.

119
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:46,165
The format is lectures plus quizzes,
as often happens in MOOCs.

120
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,602
And we also will provide
a program assignments for

121
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,770
those of you that have
the resources to do that.

122
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,875
The main refrence book for this course is  

123
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:00,313
a recent book that Sean Massung and I have co-authored.

124
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,883
the title is Text Data Management and Analysis:

125
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:08,321
A Practical Introduction to Information Retrieval and Text Mining.

126
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:12,058
However, this reference book is not required 

127
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,028
In the sense that if you follow all of the lecture videos closely

128
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:21,868
Then you should have no problem with working on the quiz 
problems and the programing assignment.

129
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,237
To pass the course 

130
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:31,911
However, the book would be useful to give you a higher
level and systematic desctiption in this course 

131
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,348
of all the topics covered in this course, plus some others

132
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:35,481
<i><b><u><font color=#00000000></font></u></b></i>

133
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,952
It will also help you understand subtopics in more depth,

134
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:46,325
So if you have a problem with following some videos, the book might be useful to you.

135
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:53,399
The book is also the reference  book for another mooc text mining and analytics.

136
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,570
If you are interested in buying the book  there is a link here,

137
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:03,276
And there should be a substantial discount for the students of this course.

138
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,543
Â Â 

139
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:14,453
There are also quite a few other useful reference books and readings 
and they are available through the link at the bottom of this slide 

140
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,323
Finally, and this is the course schedule.

141
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:22,395
That's just the top of the map for
the rest of the course,

142
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,766
and it shows the topics that we will
cover in the remaining lectures.

143
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:32,905
This picture also shows basic flow of
information in a text information system.

144
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:37,209
So starting from the big text data, the
first step is to do some natural language

145
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:43,749
content analysis, because text data is
in the form of natural language text.

146
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,286
So we need to understand
the text to some extent

147
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,722
in order to do something useful for
the users.

148
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,991
So this is the first
topic that we will cover.

149
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:57,597
And then on top of that as you
can see there are two boxes here.

150
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:02,368
Those are two types of systems
that can be used to help people

151
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,204
get access to the most relevant data.

152
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,475
Or in other words, those are the two
kinds of systems that will convert

153
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,845
big text data into small
relevant text data.

154
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,817
Search engines are helping
users to search or

155
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:22,254
to query the data to get
the most relevant documents out.

156
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:26,359
Recommender systems are to
recommend information to users,

157
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,427
to push information to users.

158
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,897
So those are two, complementary was of

159
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:36,936
getting users connected to the most
relevant data at the right time.

160
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:41,707
So this part is called text access,
and this will be the next topic.

161
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:46,479
And after we cover that we are going
to cover a number of topics,

162
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,347
all about the search engines.

163
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,484
Now the text access
topic is a brief topic,

164
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,221
a brief coverage of
the two kinds of systems.

165
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,524
In the remaining topics, we'll cover
search engines in much more detail.
