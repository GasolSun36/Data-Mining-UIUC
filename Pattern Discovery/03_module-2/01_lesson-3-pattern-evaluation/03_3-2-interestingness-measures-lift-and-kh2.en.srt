1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,845
We have learned support and confidence.

2
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:14,680
These two measures are not sufficient to describe association.

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,305
So the problem becomes what

4
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:23,959
additional interesting measures are good enough to describe their relationships?

5
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:28,825
So that's the reason we want to examine a little more like lift and

6
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:34,730
chi square whether they are good enough to describe additional interesting measures.

7
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,444
So lift has been properly used in statistics as well.

8
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:41,250
We look at the same table,

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,180
the same table we can think B means playing basketball,

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,690
C means eating cereal.

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,785
So we have the exact same distribution.

12
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,129
Then for this continuous table,

13
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,885
we use lift to compute it.

14
00:00:56,885 --> 00:01:01,730
The lift is defined as this: B and C are two item sets.

15
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,470
For rule B implies C,

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,194
that confidence if its divided by C support, we get lift.

17
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:19,890
Or we can say if BC this lose support divided by B support times C support.

18
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,945
So for this lift,

19
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:27,010
the general rule is if the lift is one,

20
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,915
then these two items are independent.

21
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:31,265
If it's greater than one,

22
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,670
they are positively correlated.

23
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,469
If it is less than one,

24
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:37,440
they are negative correlated.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,790
For our example data set,

26
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:49,050
we will calculate a lift of B and C and B and not C. We divide 0.89 and 1.33.

27
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,545
Then from those data sets and the rules we've broken C,

28
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:59,705
B and C should be negative correlated because the lift is less than one.

29
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:05,675
B and not C are positive co-related because the lift is greater than one.

30
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:12,569
This actually fix our problem because we know B and C should be negative correlated,

31
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,275
B and not C should be positive correlated.

32
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,310
So this looks very nice.

33
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:25,180
Let's look at another measure popularly used in statistics as well called chi square.

34
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,640
In chi square, the definition,

35
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,580
we need to calculate the expected value.

36
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,874
How to calculate the expected value?

37
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:38,270
If we can see this 400 is a real value, it's observed value.

38
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,650
But expect value is just based on the distribution.

39
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,640
For example C and not C the distribution is 700 over 250.

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:56,505
This is three to one and all 600 students with three to one you get 450 versus 150.

41
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:59,515
In that case, we probably can't see,

42
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:01,530
we still can't use the popular,

43
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,735
the rules like if chi square is zero, they are independent.

44
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:11,310
It's greater than zero, they are correlated either positively or negatively.

45
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,860
So we need additional test to see whether they are positively or negatively correlated.

46
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,930
Now for our example,

47
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,595
we can easy calculate chi square should be almost 76.

48
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:28,525
So B and C should be correlated.

49
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:34,270
Further, we can say they are negatively correlated because the expected value is 450.

50
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,585
The observed value is only 400. It's less.

51
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:41,130
So these teams can solve the problem as well.

52
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:47,800
But the problem becomes whether lift and chi square are good in all the cases.

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,255
Let's examine some interesting case.

54
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:59,445
In this case, you probably can see this not B not C actually is quite big.

55
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:02,459
There are 100000.

56
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,500
These actually called null transactions because the transactions contain neither B nor

57
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,690
C. And if we just look at a B and C relationship,

58
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,445
we first see B and C should be negative

59
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:19,315
correlated because it's not easy to get B and C together.

60
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:22,960
B and not C is far bigger.

61
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,355
C and not B is also far bigger.

62
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:28,510
But if we use a lift,

63
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,634
we compute a lift B and C,

64
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:34,919
we will get this 8.44 which is far bigger than one.

65
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,150
That shows B and C should be strongly positive correlated.

66
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,970
This seems not right.

67
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,840
Either we tried to use this same contingency table.

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,090
We add the expected value.

69
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,975
We do the computation.

70
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:55,130
We will find chi square is bigger than zero.

71
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,170
In the meantime, you observed value is far bigger than the expected value.

72
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,331
So we also should say B and C are strongly positively correlated.

73
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:07,855
This seems to be wrong.

74
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:09,339
What's the problem?

75
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:12,150
Actually, there are too many null transactions.

76
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,115
That may make things distorted.

77
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,659
We need to fix it.
