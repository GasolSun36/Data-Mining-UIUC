  Lesson 3: Pattern Evaluation
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Lesson Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  In the lesson, you will learn how to evaluate patterns and what kind of patterns are interesting.  You will see that the typical support-confidence association rule mining framework is not adequate for pattern evaluation, and even the popularly used lift and chi-square measures may not be good in some situations. We will introduce the concept of interestingness in pattern or rule evaluation, show the importance of null-invariance, and compare multiple interestingness measures.

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand that not all mined patterns under the support-confidence framework are interesting.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand that pattern evaluation will lead to the generation of a smaller set but will yield interesting and useful patterns.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Know that measures like lift and chi-square can be very useful in certain situations, but they may encounter difficulties in certain situations.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand the importance of null-invariance, and learn why a null-invariant measure like Kulczynski may lead to better judgement.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Know how to compare multiple interestingness measures.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while watching the video lectures throughout the lesson.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is it that the typical support-confidence association rule mining framework may sometimes lead to misleading answers?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is it important to introduce interestingness measures in pattern evaluation?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    In what conditions may lift and χ2 give you good answers for correlation analysis? In what conditions may it not work well?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What is null-invariance?  Why is it important?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Comparing with a set of interestingness measures introduced here, which one may work well under what conditions?  What is your general recommendation?
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this lesson, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
