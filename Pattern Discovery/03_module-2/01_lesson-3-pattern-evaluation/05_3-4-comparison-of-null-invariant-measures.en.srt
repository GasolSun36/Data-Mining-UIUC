1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,777
[SOUND] Now, we come down to compare

2
00:00:05,777 --> 00:00:11,312
these null invariant measures.

3
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,821
So, which one is better?

4
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:18,092
We know, we can sense not all those
null-invariant measures are created

5
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:22,519
equal so, we want to see which
one's better in all the cases.

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,533
Let's examine the two
variable contingency table of

7
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:30,580
the transactions containing milk and
coffee.

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,340
Let's look at the case in this data set.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,630
So the first, you look at D1 and
D2, D1 and D2,

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:44,460
you probably can see the difference is
only on the number of null transactions.

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,780
But you also can see very likely, milk and

12
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,750
coffee should get together,
they should be positive.

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,255
In that sense,
you can see all of those five,

14
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:59,190
null-invariant measures,
they give equal value.

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,179
In this sense, no matter how many
transactions on the null part.

16
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:06,977
Okay, they do not change their value.

17
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:09,961
And also they are very close to one,
in the sense,

18
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:13,140
these are possibly getting together.

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,030
When you look at D3,
D3 means mc getting together is quite

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,750
rare because they get along more frequent.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,735
In that sense,
all their values are very close to zero.

22
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:31,273
Then you look at the D4,
D4 says mc getting together or mc alone,

23
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:35,909
they are all like 1,000 and
1,000 and 1,000 cases.

24
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,621
No matter how many null transactions,

25
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:43,315
they actually got things right
in the middle this 0.5, 0.5.

26
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:47,527
Only Jaccard's 0.33,
actually just in Jaccard,

27
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:51,800
this one means its balance
is right in the middle.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,010
Then we look at cases,
it could be D5 and D6.

29
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,039
D5, if you see this is 1,110 solved cases.

30
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,491
So what you probably can see,
is from coffee point of view,

31
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:12,301
like a coffee guy may say,
mc are likely getting together,

32
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:17,307
because they get along as 100
cases buying coffee but not milk.

33
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:20,871
1000 cases we're buying both coffee and
milk.

34
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:26,419
But for milk guy, they probably say,
they are very unlikely getting together,

35
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:30,960
because I got 10,000 cases buying milk but
not coffee.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,040
But only 1000 case buying milk and coffee.

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,340
So, in that case you look
at different measures.

38
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,980
It's interesting to see,
All Confidence and

39
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,240
Jaccard they also say it's closer to zero,
unlikely getting together.

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,160
But Max Confidence says it's close to one,
they are very likely getting together.

41
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,240
Then we look at a Kulczynski said,
I'm right in the middle,

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,080
because the tug of the war
on each side is ten to one.

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,680
Then Cosine said, I'm a little
prone to unlikely getting together.

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,710
Now, we change this one even more.

45
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,105
This is 1,000 to ten, or 1,000 to 100,000.

46
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:13,676
The coffee guys said they are very,
very likely getting together.

47
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:19,010
But the milk guy said,
they are very unlikely getting together.

48
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,585
Now in this case,
you probably can see All Confidence and

49
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:29,440
Jaccard drop down to 0.01, and
even cosine dropped down to 0.1.

50
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,350
But if Max Confidence says, I am very
confident they are very close to one,

51
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,504
because they are very
likely getting together.

52
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:41,868
But in Kulcyzynski said, I'm still in
the neutral because this is 100 to one,

53
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:45,460
the other is one to 100,
they have the equal ratio.

54
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,360
So, which one do you like?

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,020
So, probably we can see D4 to D6.

56
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,920
The real case is, that differentiate
that five null-invariant measures.

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,190
But we probably can see,
Kulcyzynski measure

58
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,170
holds firm when in these
very imbalanced cases.

59
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,772
But the ratio is balanced on both sides,
and it holds firm at 0.5.

60
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:12,763
That looks interesting.

61
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:18,349
But on the other hand, we also know
those cases, some are very imbalanced,

62
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:23,255
we may want to introduce another
measure called imbalance ratio.

63
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:26,965
The imbalanced ratio is
introduced in the sense,

64
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:30,673
the support of item set A and
support of item set B,

65
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:36,520
their differences play important role
in this imbalance ratio computation.

66
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,001
Then you proceed for
the same cases in the last three,

67
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:44,992
the Kulcyzynski vector holds firms at 0.5.

68
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:49,920
But the imbalance ratio, okay,
D sub four cases is zero,

69
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,047
because they are already balanced.

70
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:58,960
And D sub five cases become 0.89,
they are rather imbalanced.

71
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,070
And D sub six cases,
it is very imbalanced.

72
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,930
So imbalance ratio, really can show
you how balanced the two sides are.

73
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,750
So we feel Kulcyzynski plus imbalance
ratio, these two things getting together

74
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,583
will present a clear picture for
all the three data sets, D4 through D6.

75
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,590
Because D4 is neutral and
balanced, D5 is neutral but

76
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,820
imbalanced, and D6 is neutral but
very imbalanced.

77
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,580
Finally, we're going to show you some
real data sets like a DBLP data sets,

78
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,180
we want to look at
co-author relationships.

79
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,660
So, let's look at this table.

80
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,430
This table we got around year 2007.

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,710
We study the recent database conferences,
we look at those authors,

82
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,860
they publish papers and they co-author
papers in database conferences.

83
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,760
But you can probably see,
the interesting thing is, for

84
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,290
example you look at Hans-Peter Kreigel and
Martin Pfeifle.

85
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:10,553
Martin Pfeifle got 18 papers, but all of
them are with with Hans-Peter Kriegel.

86
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:16,660
The Hans-Peter Krieger got 146 papers,
18 was with Martin Pfeifle.

87
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,520
Well, okay, you can see in that cases
Kulcyzynski shows pretty strong value that

88
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,120
simply says, these two authors
are closely tied together in some way.

89
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,235
But they are imbalanced as well.

90
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:32,664
We can see the case of imbalanced ratio,

91
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:36,410
you can either calculate
the imbalance ratio is really high.

92
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,492
So in that case,
you probably can easily judge Hans-Peter,

93
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:45,807
Kriegel likely to be
the adviser of Martin Pfeifle.

94
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:48,917
So using Kulcyzynski and imbalance ratio,

95
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:54,930
we can easily see advisor-advisee
relationships, and close collaborators.

96
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,310
In one research paper on
finding advisor-advisees,

97
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,730
we are really using those measures to
find them with reasonably high accuracy.

98
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,030
So finally,
we will show you a bunch of papers.

99
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,520
These are the papers quite representative
on how to judge the correlation

100
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,631
relationship, the different measures,
including their interest in measure,

101
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:26,050
the non-variant ones and the measure
we discussed on the Kulcyzynski.

102
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,781
Thank you.

103
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:37,781
