1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:10,669
We already seen Lift and a chi-square may not be very good measures,

2
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:16,160
examining the transaction data that contain lots of null transactions.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,679
So, what we may like to see is,

4
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,405
what are good measures?

5
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:26,420
They do not influence much by number of null transactions.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,410
Let's look at those different measures.

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,380
Some measure, they have the property called null-invariance,

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:39,810
that means their values may not change with a number of null transactions.

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,510
Let's see what measures are null-invariant,

10
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,228
what measures are not null-invariant.

11
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:48,320
We already know chi-square and a Lift,

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,969
they are not null-invariant.

13
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,055
Their value change with number on null transactions.

14
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:58,555
But, people have found that the folding five measures,

15
00:00:58,555 --> 00:00:59,770
if you check their formula,

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:05,849
their definition, they are actually null-invariant measures.

17
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:11,405
So, you probably know Jaccard coefficient and cosine measure quite well.

18
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,659
These two measures are popularly used, they're null-invariant.

19
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,144
But all confidence which actually take

20
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:23,959
the smaller value among A and B as the denominator,

21
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,135
the numerator is just the transaction support of the rule.

22
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:34,980
So, the max confidence is try to find the maximum one of them.

23
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,379
These two actually proposed in the study of measuring association rules.

24
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:47,299
Kulczynski measure was proposed around 2007 by us, by our group.

25
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,769
We originally called these as balanced measure, but later,

26
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:55,984
the reviewer actually point out that this measure was actually proposed

27
00:01:55,984 --> 00:02:01,245
by a Polish mathematician called Kulczynski in 1927.

28
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:05,269
So, we changed the name of this measure to Kulczynski measure.

29
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:07,760
Let's first look at null-invariance,

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,300
why they are very important.

31
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,814
That means why in analysis massive transaction data,

32
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:16,759
the null-invariance is so critical,

33
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,479
because in many many transactions,

34
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,705
the transaction set contain particular sets of item.

35
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:28,289
The chance actually is very rare like a warm up transactions.

36
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:31,335
They may contain neither milk nor coffee.

37
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:37,905
We will try to analyze milk and coffee using the following contingency table.

38
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:44,069
So, this m_c means the number of transactions that contain both milk and coffee.

39
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:50,990
This not m nor c means the number of transactions that contain neither milk nor coffee.

40
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,905
So, this not m nor c is the number of no transactions.

41
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:58,975
Then, we see Lift and chi-square,

42
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,789
they are not null-invariant.

43
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,590
So they are not good at evaluating data that

44
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,085
contain too many or too few null transactions.

45
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,884
For example, we just look at this,

46
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:11,849
for this dataset D1,

47
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,949
m_c means number of transactions that contain both milk and coffee;

48
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:21,319
not m_c means the number of transactions contain no milk but coffee;

49
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,659
m no c means that number of transactions that contains milk but not coffee;

50
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:30,314
not m nor c means the number of null transactions,

51
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:32,895
they contain neither me nor coffee.

52
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:36,655
So, you'll probably go to like a Walmart,

53
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:38,360
it's kind of shopping market,

54
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,449
you probably see there could be the cases you get

55
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:44,835
10,000 transactions that contain milk and a coffee,

56
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:48,754
but 1,000 contain not milk but coffee,

57
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:51,349
1,000 contain milk but not coffee.

58
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:56,465
In that case, you probably say actually likely if people buy milk,

59
00:03:56,465 --> 00:04:00,365
they would buy coffee as well because there are 10,000 such cases.

60
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,610
Buy only one of them, there's only 1,000.

61
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,365
But, if you have a lot of a null transactions,

62
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:09,620
this value could be quite positive.

63
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,509
If you have very few null transactions,

64
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:15,104
it turn out they are independent.

65
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:17,600
You probably look at the value they are not independent.

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,189
On the other hand, if you see there's only 100 cases,

67
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:23,060
you're got a milk and coffee together.

68
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,199
There are many more cases,

69
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,505
they buy it alone.

70
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:28,324
But once you have many null transactions,

71
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:30,810
it turns out to be very positive.

72
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,305
The number is quite big.

73
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,600
So, no matter you get a very many null transactions,

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,592
so very few null transactions,

75
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:39,509
something may go wrong.

76
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:46,185
So, we do need to analyze such data using some null-invariance measures.

77
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,220
We'll examine this in more detail.
