2
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:09,284
The first thing we want to discuss is,

3
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:12,840
The Limitation of
the Support Confidence Framework.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,940
As we know, pattern mining may
generate a large number of rules but

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,190
not all of the patterns and
rules generated are interesting.

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,997
In general we can classify the interesting
measures into two classes,

7
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,565
objective versus subjective.

8
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:37,171
For objective measure like support,
confidence,

9
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:41,883
correlation are defined
by mathematical formulas,

10
00:00:41,883 --> 00:00:45,136
not change from person to to person.

11
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:48,845
But the subjective measure may
change from person to person,

12
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:53,190
because one man's trash could
be another man's treasure.

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,400
So the first thing, is we may want
a user to say, what do you like to see?

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,127
So it's query based.

15
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:04,287
Another thing is we may base
on user's knowledge base,

16
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:08,278
try to mine something unexpected,
fresh or recent.

17
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:12,878
Or we can map patterns and
rules into two-dimensional space,

18
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:17,150
let user to interactively
pick some interesting things.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,060
So we know we have support and

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,770
confidence as two interestingness
measures in association rules.

21
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:32,290
So we may be careful about this,
because not all the strong

22
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,440
support and
confidence rules are interesting.

23
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,510
For example, take the following table,
a 2-way contingency table,

24
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,010
to look at this to see how to
interpret things we found.

25
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:53,120
For example, in this table, 400 out
of 1000 students play basketball and

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,640
eating cereal, but 200 students, they play
basketball but they may not eat cereal.

27
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,880
In this one,
you may derive association rule like this.

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,490
Playing basketball implies eating cereal.

29
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:12,564
You probably will get a 40% support
because it's 400 over 1,000.

30
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:17,890
You will get two thirds of the confidence
because you get 400 over 600.

31
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,050
So this is pretty high support and
confidence.

32
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,520
Is this really interesting?

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,213
Let me try another rule regenerated.

34
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:33,587
Actually you will see, if we say not
playing basketball, eating cereal.

35
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:40,519
You will see not playing basketball is
35%, with the confidence even higher,

36
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:46,260
because they have 350 eating
cereal out of 400 people.

37
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,150
So this one is even higher.

38
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,930
So, if you recommend these two
rules to the cereal company,

39
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,440
they will get confused.

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,050
They'll say, the first rule say that
I better give some free basketball

41
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,990
because if they play basketball,
eating cereal.

42
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,790
The second rule say I better
take their basketball away,

43
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,060
because if they do not play basketball
they actually eat cereal even more.

44
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,370
Which one is right?

45
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,976
Let's examine it.

46
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:23,976
