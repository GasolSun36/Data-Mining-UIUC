1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,650
Now we come down to another interesting issue,

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,994
it's mining multi-dimensional association rules.

3
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:14,769
Sometimes the items or the things

4
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:17,650
we want to mine are actually sitting on the multi-dimensions.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,010
The single dimension rule we studied,

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,184
for example, X buys milk,

7
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:24,969
then X buys bread.

8
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:29,414
Milk and bread, both are from the same kind of dimension

9
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:33,919
called product but sometimes we may get a multi-dimensional association rules.

10
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:37,820
For example, for this inter-dimensional association rule,

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,884
like if X age is 18 to 25 and

12
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:50,570
if X occupation is a student then likely X going to buy a Coke.

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,024
That was actually H, occupation,

14
00:00:54,024 --> 00:00:57,819
and items to buy are three different dimensions.

15
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:01,375
That kind of rule we call inter-dimensional association rule.

16
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:06,594
Then even we look at this sometimes we see the Hybrid cases,

17
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:10,069
like if X age is 18 to 25,

18
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:15,004
if X buys popcorn likely X is going to buy coke.

19
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:17,609
That kind of rule you have H as

20
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,280
one dimension but these two buys are seeing the same damages.

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,305
Okay. So if you see this kind of cases,

22
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:32,769
they likely these three different cases may slightly need different kind of algorithms.

23
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:37,900
Another thing is that attributes can be categorical, can be numerical.

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,724
For example, the categorical case could be product like

25
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:49,084
beer and diapers and you may have a profession like a student or a professor.

26
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:51,954
So, for these categorical attributes

27
00:01:51,954 --> 00:01:53,363
we can for multi-dimensional, inter-dimensional association rules,

28
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:58,769
we can construct a data cube to mine

29
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:04,980
such things or just use data cube structure to mine such association efficiently.

30
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,314
Then, another case could be

31
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:12,203
quantitive attributes or we can say those attributes are numerically.

32
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:16,570
For example, H [inaudible] or some other things.

33
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:23,534
For this case it's quite often we may use this criterization method, clustering method,

34
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:27,175
some kind of gradient approaches we are going to discuss this part

35
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:32,129
in the quantitative association rule of mining. Thank you.
