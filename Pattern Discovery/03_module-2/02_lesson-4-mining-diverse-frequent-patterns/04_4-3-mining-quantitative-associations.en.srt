00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:07,120
[SOUND]
Now we come down to

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,340
study another interesting issue called
mining quantitative associations.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,705
What is quantitative association?

4
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:18,980
Quantitative association
means some attributes

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,890
after a numerical data like age and
a salary.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,950
So how to mine such rules?

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,052
There's one way is we can
do static discretization.

8
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:35,621
The reason we need to do static
discretization is if you do not discretize

9
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:41,214
them, you're trying to parallelized
every possible age and a salary.

10
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:44,120
You will not be able to
find any interesting or

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,270
sensitive rules with sufficient support.

12
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:53,280
But if we try to say,
we partition age every ten years,

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,610
or partition income every
$10,000 using some predefined

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,810
concept of hierarchy, we are going to
be able to construct a data cube and

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,949
we're going to be able to generate
some interesting association.

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,990
But this fixed,

17
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,880
predefined concept hierarchy may
not fit your data distribution.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,345
For example, in the university,

19
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:20,262
likely you may want to
partition the age for students.

20
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:25,330
You may say it's 18 to 20,
20 to 22, or something like that.

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:31,756
But for income, you may say $10,000
is one partition or low and high.

22
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:33,870
But if you go to hospital,

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,680
their age distribution you may like
to say middle age or old or young.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,300
So another way is we do
clustering based on data.

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,600
That means we take every dimension,
we study their distribution of the age and

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,240
income, we perform certain clustering
algorithm, generate a few clusters,

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,900
and then we find the parallelized frequent
pattern of each such cluster of pairs.

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,200
Then finally there's also popular
ways to do deviation analysis.

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,360
That means instead of
doing fixed interval,

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,755
we may do based on certain
condition like gender is female.

31
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:21,773
We may find their mean or a median or
something, some statistic measure,

32
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:26,723
you will find if the wage mean
is substantially deviated from

33
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:31,620
the overall mean,
then this could be an interesting rule.

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,690
Let's go a little further to see
how to find some such deviation.

35
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,290
We also call extraordinary or
interesting phenomena.

36
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,786
Usually for this we may say the left-hand
side is a subset of the population and

37
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:51,782
the right-hand side is some kind of
extraordinary behavior expressed

38
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:57,280
using some statistical measure which
could deviate from the overall.

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,210
Then the rule, whether is true rule or
is just a very exceptional case,

40
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,000
we need to do some statistic test,
like a Z-test,

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,970
to confirm whether such kind
of rule is of high confidence.

42
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,130
Further, in many cases,

43
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,820
you may even want to go deeper to
get a subset of the population, for

44
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,270
example, not only look at the gender as
female, but look at the location as south.

45
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,500
You may get the wage could further
deviate from the overall mean,

46
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,890
or even from the bigger rule
like a gender is female.

47
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,320
So that subrule could become
a extraordinary subrule

48
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,670
associated with its super rule.

49
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,230
For example, sometimes you do not have the
left-hand side as a subset of population,

50
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,190
but based on numerical data you can group
them into certain intervals or clusters.

51
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,960
For example, the left-hand
side could be if the education

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,040
has pretty many years,
like 14 to 18 years, and

53
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,050
you will find the mean wage actually
is substantially higher than the mean,

54
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,740
so that may form another
interesting quantitative rule.

55
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,642
Efficient methods actually have
been developed to mine such

56
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,288
extraordinary rules.

57
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:28,736
For example,
one research paper published by Aumann and

58
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:37,150
Lindell@KDD'99 is a very interesting case
study of a very interesting algorithm.
