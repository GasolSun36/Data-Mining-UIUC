2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,938
Now, we study another interesting issue
called mining negative correlations.

3
00:00:11,938 --> 00:00:17,720
So we first need to distinguish rare
patterns and negative patterns.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,410
What is a rare pattern?

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,820
Rare pattern usually means there
are some rare occurring items,

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,438
they have very low support but
they are interesting.

7
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:29,110
We want to catch such patterns.

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,240
For example, buying Rolex watches.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,200
How to mine such patterns?

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,200
We previously already discussed this.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,777
For different item sets like for
those rare items, we should be able to

12
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:47,448
set some individualized group based and
minimum supports threshold.

13
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:51,466
That means for rare patterns for
just those items,

14
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:55,767
we should set a rather low
minimum support threshold,

15
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:59,428
then we'll be able to
capture such patterns.

16
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:02,968
But negative patterns could be
another very different one.

17
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:07,830
Negative patterns is those patterns
that are negatively correlated.

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,410
That means they are unlikely
happen together.

19
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,350
So for example, if you find some customer,
the same customer,

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,300
who buys Ford Expedition,
which is a SUV car, and

21
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,750
also a Ford Fusion,
a hybrid car, together.

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,360
So they are unlikely to happen together,
so

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,960
we called these patterns
negative correlated patterns.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,870
The problem becomes how
to define such patterns?

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,650
We may have one support-based
definition like this.

26
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,090
We say, if the itemsets A and
B getting together their

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,290
support is far less than sup(A) x sup(B),

28
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,800
that means a chance to get together
is far less than random, okay?

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,830
Then we can say A and
B are negatively correlated.

30
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,720
Is this a good definition?

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,710
Actually, this definition may
remind us the definition of lift.

32
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,299
Then we may see whether they work well for
large transaction data sets.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,090
Let's look at one example.

34
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,300
Suppose a store sold two needle packages,
A and B 100 times each,

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,950
but only one transaction
containing both A and B.

36
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,770
Then we will see these two needle packages
A and B are likely negatively correlated.

37
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,280
But when there are in total only
200 transactions in your datasets,

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,500
you may see s(A U B) getting together,

39
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,840
because they got only one time, so
1 over 200, you get this number.

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,070
This is pretty small number.

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:56,065
But then he look at s(A) which is 100
over 200 transaction so it's 0.5.

42
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:58,260
Same as s(B).

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,100
So their product should be 0.25.

44
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,200
So this number is far bigger than this.

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,510
That means s(A U B) getting together
is far less than s(A) x s(B).

46
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,150
So we can easily say A and
B are negatively correlated,

47
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,210
they are negatively correlated patterns.

48
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,592
Okay, but when this store, so
in total 10 to the power of 5,

49
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:28,365
that means 100,000 transactions.

50
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:34,485
Then suppose all the others does
not contain package of A nor B.

51
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:38,701
Then the situation could
be completely different,

52
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:43,600
because s(A U B) together is
1 over 10 to the power of 5.

53
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,693
But s(A) now is 100 over 100,000,
so you get 1 over 1000.

54
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:53,359
s(B) is also 1 over 1000,

55
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:58,320
when they time together you get
1 over 10 to the power of 6.

56
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,990
This number is even smaller than A and
B getting together.

57
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,330
You may say, A and
B getting together is very frequent or

58
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,000
it's passive correlated,
actually it's not.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,440
What's the problem?

60
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,080
The problem actually is null transactions.

61
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,120
Because there are so many transactions
that contain neither A nor

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,279
B, they are null transactions.

63
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,620
So we probably can see a good
definition of negative correlation

64
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,750
should take care of the null
invariance problem.

65
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,512
That means, when two itemsets A and
B are identical related,

66
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:37,993
they should not be influenced.

67
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:40,863
Okay, whether they are an negative
correlated or not,

68
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,295
they should not be influenced by
the number of null transactions.

69
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:47,955
Okay, now we give you another
interesting definition,

70
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:51,318
which is a Kulczynzki
measure-based definition.

71
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:56,702
That means if we want to say A and
B whether they are negative correlated,

72
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:59,858
what we need to see is A and
B are frequent.

73
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:04,557
But the condition the probability
of A under condition of B and

74
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:11,500
the probability of B under condition of A,
their average should be less than epsilon.

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,052
Where epsilon is a small negative
pattern support threshold.

76
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:21,538
Then we probably can see A and
B negative correlated can be justified for

77
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,830
our needle package problem.

78
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,850
We can see no matter there are in total
200 transactions, or 100,000 transactions,

79
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,730
if we say epsilon is 0.01,
we probably can see this

80
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,760
Kulczynski measure based judgement, we can
easily see the average of the conditional

81
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,020
probability should be less than epsilon,
so they are negative correlated.

82
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,020
So this seems to be very interesting and
a good definition.

83
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,490
And how to mine them,
actually these are the method similar to

84
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,790
our previously discussed
pattern mining method.

85
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,068
We will not discuss it further.

86
