  Pattern Discovery in Data Mining Syllabus
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Course Description
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this course, you will get to know one important subfield in data mining: pattern discovery.  You will learn why pattern discovery is important, what the major tricks are for efficient pattern mining, and how to apply pattern discovery in some interesting applications.  This course provides you the opportunity to learn concepts, principles, and skills to practice and engage in scalable pattern discovery methods on massive data; discuss pattern evaluation measures; study methods for mining diverse kinds of frequent patterns, sequential patterns, and sub-graph patterns; and explore their applications.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Course Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  By the end of this course, you will be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>

   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Identify efficient pattern mining methods, such as Apriori, ECLAT, and FPgrowth.

  Elements of This Course
 </h2>
 <p>
  The course is comprised of the following elements:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Lecture videos
    </strong>
    :  Each week your instructor will teach you the concepts you need to know through a collection of short video lectures. You may either stream these videos for playback within the browser by clicking on their titles, or you can download each video for later offline playback by clicking the download icon.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     In-lecture questions:
    </strong>
    Some lectures have questions associated with them to help verify your understanding of the topics. These questions will automatically appear while watching the video if you stream the video through your browser. The questions are available as a separate downloadable text file for those who prefer to download the videos. These questions do not contribute toward your final score in the class.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Quizzes
    </strong>
    :  Each lesson will include one graded quiz. Your cumulative score will be used when calculating your final score in the class. There is no time limit on how long you take to complete each quiz.  The deadline for all quizzes is the last day of the course.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Programming assignments
    </strong>
    : There are two programming assignments for this class. The first programming assignment is about understand and implementation of the most well-known frequent pattern mining algorithm: Apriori, based on some real-lie dataset; and the second programming assignment is about understanding and implementation of some simple method for contiguous sequence pattern mining and phrase mining, based on some real-life dataset. The first programming assignment is required for the Course Certificate. The second programming assignment is optional.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

  To qualify for a Course Certificate, simply start verifying your coursework at the beginning of the course, get a
  <strong>
   75% or higher on all graded lesson quizzes
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   70% or higher on the
   <u>
    required
   </u>
   programming assignment
  </strong>
  , and pay the fee. Coursera

 <p>
  Also note that this course is in the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/datamining/20">
   Data Mining Specialization
  </a>
  offered by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. By earning a Course Certificate in this course, you are on your way toward earning a
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/datamining">
   Specialization Certificate in Data Mining
  </a>
  . You may also choose to pre-pay for the entire Specialization, at a discount. See more information about

 </p>
 <p>
  If you choose not to pay the fee, you can still audit the course. You will still be able to view all videos, submit practice quizzes, and view required assessments.  Auditing does not include the option to submit required assessments.  As such, you will not be able to earn a grade or a Course Certificate.
