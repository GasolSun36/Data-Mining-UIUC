  Social Media

 <p>
  Learning takes place not only through direct instruction in excellent courses but also through quality interaction with your peers. Research suggests that creating and/or joining a learning community around your interests and passions helps you stay motivated to learn. You are encouraged to leverage social media platforms to connect with thousands of your peers from across the world. Learn from others, network, share what you learn, create study groups, discuss interesting course topics as well as off-topic ideas, and share your own perspectives about this subject. You can even set up or get notified about physical meetups on these forums so that you donâ€™t miss out any opportunity to interact face-to-face with those who share your interests. Remember that the more active these communities are, the more value they will bring to all. We are also looking for participants in the course to take a leading role in keeping these communities active and of value to all of us, so do join your preferred platform and share!
