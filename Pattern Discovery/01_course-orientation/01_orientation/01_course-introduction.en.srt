00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:05,100
Hi, welcome to the course
Pattern Discovery in Data Mining.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,010
Here I'm giving you a general
overview of this course.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:17,150
This course is one of six courses being
offered by the University of Illinois

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:23,340
at Urbana-Champaign,
as a data mining specialization series.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,230
Data mining specialization
consists of six courses.

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,640
Data Visualization,
Text Retrieval and Search Engines,

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,770
Text Mining and Analytics,
Pattern Discovery in Data Mining,

8
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,030
Cluster Analysis in Data Mining,
and finally, Data Mining Capstone.

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,270
This final Data Mining Capstone
is a project oriented courses

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,210
using the knowledge you learned
in the first five, six courses.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,669
So first you may wonder,
what is pattern discovery?

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,290
So I'd better first give you example.

13
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,780
Considering massive
shopping transaction data,

14
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,230
pattern discovery may help you
answer the following questions.

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,510
What groups of items
are frequently bought together?

16
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,440
If a person buys diapers at night,

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,040
what is possibility of this
person buying beer as well?

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:30,080
If a customer buys an iPhone 5 or
iPhone 7, what other electronic

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,439
products will the customer be most
likely to buy in the next three months?

20
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,700
So you probably can see pattern
discovery is quite interesting.

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,940
What is the value of pattern discovery?

22
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,150
Pattern discovery may help
you find the hidden and

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,920
inherent data patterns in massive data.

24
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,260
Pattern mining will play a unique and
critical role in mining massive data.

25
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,340
What roles does pattern discovery play

26
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,540
in this particular data
mining specialization series?

27
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,250
In this course,

28
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,680
you will learn scalable methods to
find patterns from massive data.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,880
The patterns maybe the set of data items
strongly correlated to each other.

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,680
You will learn how to mine
a large variety of patterns.

31
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,615
You will also learn how
to evaluate the patterns.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,200
And finally, you will find the pattern
discovery may help classification,

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,655
clustering, and
many other data mining tasks.

34
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:44,460
Pattern mining has very
broad applications.

35
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,190
We already see it may predict
shopping transaction data.

36
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,940
For example, for
a customer who buys products A and B,

37
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,629
what is the likelihood the customer
will buy product C as well?

38
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,640
It may predict a web click streams for
example, based on the current data

39
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,690
you may want to see which webpage is
most likely to be clicked the next.

40
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,570
It may help mining software bugs.

41
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,720
Where is the likely bug in this program?

42
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:27,700
It may identify objects or sub-structures
in images, videos, and social media.

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,550
It may help finding quality phrases,
entities, and

44
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,030
attributes in massive text data.

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,590
It may help repeating DNA and
protein sequences in genomes.

46
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:50,460
It may help find hidden communities
in massive social network.

47
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,550
There are several major reference
readings for this course.

48
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,178
We will have a textbook,
the textbook is written by me,

49
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:04,298
Micheline Kamber and Jian Pei,
published in year 2011,

50
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:08,380
called Data Mining Concepts and
Techniques.

51
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:14,117
This is the third edition
published by Morgan Kaufmann.

52
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:18,141
The following three chapters
are most related to the course.

53
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:20,390

Chapter 7, Advanced Pattern Mining.

57
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,260
Other references will be listed
at the end of each lecture video.

58
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,360

72
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,660
These two lessons from Module 4.

73
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:50,770
For the general information about
this course, I am the instructor.

74
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,750
I'm a Professor in Department
of Computer Science,

75
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,670
University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign.

76
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:05,060
We will have some teaching assistants who
will help me editing this courses and

77
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,370
in the meantime, giving some quizzes and
program assignments.

78
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,670
The course prerequisite is as long
as you are familiar with basic data

79
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:22,930
structures and algorithms, you will
have no problem to take this course.

80
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,406
The course will be assessed by
the following three measures.

81
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:29,490
We have in-video questions.

82
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,440
At the end of the lesson,
we have lesson quizzes.

83
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,340
We also will be giving two
programming assignments.

84
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,120
We have one required
programming assignment.

85
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,640
The second one is an optional one,
it is not required for passing the course.

86
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,185
Hope you will enjoy this
interesting course.

87
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:51,366
Welcome.
