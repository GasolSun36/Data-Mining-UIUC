In this session,

2
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:10,914
I'm going to introduce you another
interesting applications of

3
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:15,129
Pattern Discovery called
Pattern Discovery for Image Analysis.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,780
We know image analysis or

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,070
computer vision, there have been lots
of technology developed in this field.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,440
Then for, there's one
interesting recent line of work

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,460
is using visual pattern
discovery to do image analysis.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,770
We can take this picture as a example.

9
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,140
For this image, we may find
there are many interest points.

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,670
These interest points we
call visual primitives.

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,902
Every visual primitives can be described
by a set of visual features or

12
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:59,346
you can think is a high
dimension feature vector.

13
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:03,810
And then, each image is
a collection of visual primitives.

14
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:09,420
Then, we will study how to turn those
visual primitives into patterns and

15
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,070
how to do pattern minning
on large number of images.

16
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,600
So that means we want to study
visual pattern discovery problem.

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,640
For visual pattern discovery,
we can think about it from this images.

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,733
We can use feature extraction.

19
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:34,207
We can extract lots of high dimension
features, they form visual primitives.

20
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:38,094
Those visual primitives can be clustered,

21
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:43,800
based on their space they may
cluster into visual items, okay?

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,930
Those visual items, if they are similar,
then they belong to the same item.

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,450
You can map them into different item ID,
for example.

24
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,770
You can map this feature into W, and

25
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,558
maybe another picture I have of similar
one, they actually also called W, okay?

26
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:09,010
Then each visual primitive, they can have,
based on that k-nearest-neighbor,

27
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:15,650
they can form small clusters, and those
we usually called them a transaction.

28
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,629
For example,
you may find these three visual primitives

29
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,992
can form a transaction
like CBA as a transaction.

30
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:32,457
Then an image may have many transactions,
okay, in every image.

31
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:38,049
Then if there are many, many images,
you may, based on their transactions,

32
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:44,000
you do the frequent pattern mining, you
will be able to find some visual patterns.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,580
For example, in these pictures,
you may find a BA and CA,

34
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,549
actually are quite frequent
together in those transactions.

35
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,798
So you can say, B and CA or
CBA are frequent patterns,

36
00:02:58,798 --> 00:03:03,830
are the frequent visual
patterns in those images.

37
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,910
So the simple example could be this,
suppose we have four pictures.

38
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:18,200
Each picture you may find note, certain
primitives, visual primitives from items.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,259
Those items based on
the k-nearest-neighbor,

40
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,320
they form transactions.

41
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,980
Then for this car,
you may find the two transactions here,

42
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,630
G12 and G13, okay?

43
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,740
Then they contain a set of items,

44
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,250
EDABC, could be the transactions
containing those items.

45
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,877
Each item actually is a set of visual
primitives from the items, okay?

46
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,350
But if you do frequent pattern mining,
you may find among those images,

47
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,110
you can get an AB as frequent item set and

48
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,950
actually these AB wrapped in something
related to the wheels of the car.

49
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,820
So that's a reason those frequent
pattern mining can help identify

50
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,149
certain unique features
in different images.

51
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,890
So then the interesting thing could be,

52
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,590
because images are spatial data,
then spatial configuration does matter.

53
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,923
Then because sometimes those
transactions spatially very close,

54
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:29,130
they may overlap each other.

55
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,480
Then they may have over counting problem.

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,783
For example, this AB actually in this
image, there is only one such AB pattern.

57
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:41,350
But since based on your feature
image there, clustered together,

58
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,729
you get two transactions, you actually
count AB twice in this picture, okay?

59
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:49,480
So, there's a over counting problem.

60
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,622
Another problem encountered in this visual
pattern discovery is uncertainty problem.

61
00:04:55,622 --> 00:05:00,020
Because you may have some,
like those wheels

62
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,417
can be partially occluded
by other objects or

63
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:09,987
mixed with other objects,
we have lots of noise, okay?

64
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:12,070
Some feature you may
not be able to detect.

65
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,300
Another is visual synonym and
polysemy problem that essentially is

66
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,681
sometimes the same feature actually
may erupt in different objects or

67
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:29,349
one object can be represented by
different kinds of feature sets, okay?

68
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,730
So we need to revise our

69
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,635
frequent pattern discovery algorithm
to handle these over counting problem,

70
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:44,090
uncertainty problems, synonym and
the polysemy problems.

71
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,495
Actually, there are interesting studies in
computer vision community, they developed

72
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:54,273
some interesting visual pattern discovery
methods for images and video data.

73
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:58,231
So if you are interest in this,

74
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:03,713
I would recommend you study those research

75
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:10,122
papers to gain your
knowledge to certain depths.

76
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:15,859
