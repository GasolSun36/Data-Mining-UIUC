1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,696
Now we come down to the very last
session of this lecture which is also

2
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:15,010
the very last session of this
short course, Looking Forward.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,070
We have studied a lot of
pattern discovery methods,

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:27,080
some advanced concepts,
some algorithms and lots of applications.

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,140
We'll probably see there are lots
of interesting issue to be studied

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,032
from the first paper in this field,

7
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:39,090
like 1993 up to now year 2015,
we introduced various

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,170
kinds of research discoveries and
methods, even last until today.

9
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,429
So this is still interesting research and
application domain in data mining.

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,260
So what we want to
emphasize is how we further

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,720
build up a new applications using
invisible pattern mining approach.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,870
What is invisible pattern mining?

13
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,420
It's you build this pattern mining
measures into various kinds of functions,

14
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:16,190
like a search function, ranking function,
recommendation, or other mining functions.

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,660
Sometimes when people search the web,

16
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,160
the may not know they implicitly
are using pattern mining results.

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,940
For example, we haven't seen
we're studying classification,

18
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,400
there are so many classification methods.

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,380
But definitely, frequent,

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,480
and discriminative-pattern mining
could be an interesting contribution

21
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,680
to the different repositories of
the methods on classification.

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,740
Then we also studied a graph indexing and
a similarity search.

23
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,010
When you do indexing you do search,
you do various kind of retrieval,

24
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,918
you may use index constructive
by pattern analysis.

25
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:02,320
Then even for pattern mining we may
first mine frequent patterns and

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,160
doing topic modeling then we can get
lots of interesting premises and

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,910
features for effective text mining.

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,090
When people doing software analysis, you
may use pattern mining methods to discuss

29
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,590
lots of bugs or
software specification regularities and

30
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,540
patterns, which may help us
to find bugs in software.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,660
For spatiotemporal trajectory or
moment pattern mining,

32
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,150
you may see the frequent pattern
analysis can be an interesting

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,400
method added to this set of weapons.

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,100
Then for image mining, multimedia data
mining, like a video-audio analysis,

35
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,240
the pattern analysis could be an implicit
approach method built inside.

36
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,760
Even for biological and chemical data
analysis, like analyze DNA sequences or

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,950
biological graphs, lots of pattern
mining may be used as primitives.

38
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,870
Even in clustering for

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,020
example we are going to study clustering
in data mining in this course.

40
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,240
I'm going to introduce you
subspace clustering, which

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,270
actually frequent pattern mining will
become another interesting technique for

42
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,030
subspace clustering.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,550
Even people search the web or
make a recommendation of your products,

44
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,300
or study click streams
to enhance your search.

45
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,870
The pattern mining may play
an important role in this.

46
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,830
So, you probably can see pattern
mining can be applied in many,

47
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,860
many different domains.

48
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,200
So, this invisible pattern mining
could be very important taking

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,120
this as a pre-processing of some
component in your whole analysis package.

50
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,270
So we are facing very big data,
we're facing lots of challenges but

51
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,260
the pattern mining surely is a tool.

52
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,295
So I hope by learning this course,
you will become part of research and

53
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:11,250
development force to push
pattern mining into new era

54
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,470
on post research and applications.

55
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,820
Hopefully in the future in your work,

56
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,530
you may find using the material
learned from this course.

57
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,056
You're going to develop some
interesting functions and

58
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:29,968
push the technology into
application into the new frontier.

59
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,280
Thank you.
