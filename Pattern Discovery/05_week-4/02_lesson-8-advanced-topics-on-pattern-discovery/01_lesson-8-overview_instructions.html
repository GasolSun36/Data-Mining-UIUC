  Lesson 8: Advanced Topics on Pattern Discovery
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Lesson Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this lesson, you will learn several advanced topics on pattern discovery including mining frequent patterns in data streams, pattern discovery for software bug mining, pattern discovery for image analysis, and pattern discovery and society: privacy-preserving pattern mining.   Finally, we look forward to the future on research and applications of pattern mining.

  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while watching the video lectures throughout the lesson.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is it challenging to mine frequent patterns in data streams, even to mine frequent single items?  Why can lossy counting ensure the error bound no matter how long the data stream is?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is pattern discovery useful for mining software bugs?  How can a bug mining problem such as copy-and-paste bug mining transform into a pattern mining problem?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is pattern mining useful for image analysis?  Can you give one good example to show pattern discovery may help identify critical components in image analysis?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why do we want to ensure privacy in pattern analysis? Can you present one case in which privacy can be ensured in frequent pattern mining?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What are the cool research issues in pattern mining that may have interesting new applications?
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this lesson, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
