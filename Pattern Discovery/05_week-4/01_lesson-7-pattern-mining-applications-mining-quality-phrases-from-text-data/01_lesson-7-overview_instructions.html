  Lesson 7: Pattern Mining Applications: Mining Quality Phrases from Text Data
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Lesson Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this lesson, we will study concepts and methods for mining quality phrases from text data as one kind of pattern mining application.   We will examine a few previously developed phrase-mining methods and introduce two newer methods for phrase mining: ToPMine and SegPhrase, and show the two newly developed methods may generate quality phrases from massive text corpora.

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand that phrase mining is an important task in text mining, and it is desirable to develop phrase mining methods that need no or minimal training efforts.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Know several topic-modeling related phrase mining methods and the advantages and disadvantages of those methods.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand the four criteria used at judging the quality of phrases in KERT are general and impactful in subsequent studies.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand why ToPMine may generate quality phrase without training data.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand why SegPhrase may generate even better quality phrases than ToPMine, and how a small set of training data is used in the SegPhrase phrase mining process.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while watching the video lectures throughout the lesson.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    What is the relationship between pattern discovery and phrase mining?  If the previous methods cannot build up the explicit links, will the two recently developed methods give you more explicit answers?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is it desirable to develop phrase mining methods that need no or minimal training efforts?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What are the major difficulties of phrase mining using some topic-modeling related methods, such as TNG, TurboTopic, and KERT?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What are the four interesting criteria to judge the quality of phrases developed in KERT?  Why are they also quite useful in ToPMine and SegPhrase?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is it that ToPMine can generate quality phrases without training data?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What is the role of phrasal segmentation in phrase mining?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is it that SegPhrase may generate even better quality phrases than ToPMine, and how is a small set of training data is used in the SegPhrase phrase mining process?

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this lesson, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
