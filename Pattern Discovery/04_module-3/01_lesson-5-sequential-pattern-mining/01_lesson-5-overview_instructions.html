  Lesson 5: Sequential Pattern Mining
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Lesson Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  Many interesting applications may need to find
  <em>
   sequential patterns
  </em>
  (i.e., frequent subsequences) in large sequence databases.   In this lesson, we will learn three efficient sequential pattern mining methods: (1) an Apriori-based sequential pattern mining method, GSP; (2) a vertical data format-based sequential pattern method, SPADE; and (3) a pattern-growth-based sequential pattern mining method, PrefixSpan.   Moreover, we will learn the concept of mining closed sequential patterns and introduce an efficient closed sequential pattern mining method, CloSpan.

  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while watching the video lectures throughout the lesson.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is sequential pattern mining important in many applications?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How does Apriori-based sequential pattern mining work?  What are its strengths and weaknesses?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    In comparison with the horizontal data format, what are the advantages to exploring sequential pattern mining in the vertical data format?

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this lesson, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
