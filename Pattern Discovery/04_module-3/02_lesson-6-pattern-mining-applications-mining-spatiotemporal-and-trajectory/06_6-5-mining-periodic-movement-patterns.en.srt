1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:08,040
Now we study another interesting issue
called Mining Periodic Movement Patterns.

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,690
Usually the sensor may
register movement data, but

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,240
in many cases you may
have very sparse data.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,230
Just giving you a very
interesting example.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,849
For example, animal scientists or
bird scientists,

6
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,140
they would like to study animal
movements and bird movements.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,270
They put censors on
the body of those animals.

8
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:41,140
But remember the sensor
usually is pretty small,

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,330
on the other hand it will last,
it will need to be last for a long time.

10
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,910
Like, for a study of bird migration,

11
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,428
a sensor on the body of the bird
is expected to last for a year.

12
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:58,715
So, how could a sensor be lasting for

13
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:03,150
a year without charging the battery?

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,600
The only thing you can think is
we will get very sparse data,

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,580
like 24 hours we may only register
one GPS location although

16
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,326
24 hours the birds may fly very far away.

17
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:22,920
Then if we want to find the periodicity,

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,350
the interesting thing could
be it's very hard to find

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,390
the periodicity if there's not overlap,
just because the data is so sparse.

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,170
Then just to look at how to,
thinking about bird flying patterns,

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,840
we just think the bird, suppose this
place is the nest of the bird, okay.

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,550
Then, if you just look at the bird,

23
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,650
how they exactly fly with
a very sparse sensor data,

24
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:02,030
you'll not be able to find any meaningful
periodic patterns of bird flying.

25
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,170
However, you may find every night,

26
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,915
every evening the birds were
flying back to the nest.

27
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:15,070
[COUGH] In the morning it
will fly out from the nest.

28
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,610
So, from the nest point of view or

29
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,989
from the cluster center point of
view it does have some periodicity.

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:31,150
Then we may take such location
as our reference spots.

31
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,864
That means the reference spots can
be detected using density-based

32
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:41,880
method because they come
back quite frequently.

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,696
Then with this,
if we do just based on the nest,

34
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:53,080
we say when they're in the nest,
when they're out of the nest,

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,130
so we will be able to find a nice and
interesting periodic patterns.

36
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,900
That means the periodicity is more obvious

37
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,010
when we look at the binary sequence
like in and out of the nest.

38
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,660
So that's interesting [INAUDIBLE]
can see if we only think of

39
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,650
a nest the periodicity will
be able to be detected for

40
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,669
each reference spot using
Fourier Transform and auto-correlation.

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,360
Now we look at an interesting
example on mining

42
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,610
periodic patterns with sparse data.

43
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,818
This is a real data sets about
birds flying in North America.

44
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:44,583
So this actually accumulate
three-year bird migration data,

45
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,750
they are very, very sparse.

46
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,719
However, if you based on the dense points,

47
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,226
you take those dense
regions as reference spots,

48
00:03:56,226 --> 00:04:00,516
you will be able to find
a periodicity because in

49
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:05,149
the winter they're going
to fly down to the South.

50
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:08,957
In the summer they may
fly back to the North.

51
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:15,400
In the middle they may fly some
places to have some other activities,

52
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,300
so you will find a few
interesting reference spots.

53
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,880
Once we detect periodicity based
on those reference points,

54
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,820
we will be able to summarize such
patterns in a periodic way because we

55
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,200
find a period and
we find the nice periodic patterns.

56
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,529
So this is an interesting study,
based on the very sparse

57
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:47,866
data we will be able to mine periodic
behaviors for moving objects.

58
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:53,759
Then the previous study we
will assume the periodicity

59
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:01,060
can be detected because the period
is sort of knowing, okay.

60
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,340
Then, in many cases, the time related
data can be scattered and sparse.

61
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,230
For example, phone calls at a location,
they could be very sparse.

62
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,730
And then for such sparse data,
if we look at the time,

63
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:23,730
we will be able to map
the calling time in the sequence

64
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:29,290
based on the time you're say 5,
13, 26, 29.

65
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:36,962
If you map this into the time sequence,
it's very hard to find a periodicity.

66
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:44,080
Then what about if we can
guess a right period, like t.

67
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,067
If t is 20, if we guess it right,

68
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:52,221
you probably can easily see
they form a very dense cluster.

69
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:58,191
However, if you got a wrong
guess on the period,

70
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:05,920
likely this mapping will be
scattered along the whole period.

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,647
So that means the projection
on the true period,

72
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:16,320
it will show highly skewed
(clustered) distribution.

73
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,520
Based on this observation,
some in-depth study and

74
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,220
algorithm have been developed
to detect the true pattern

75
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,580
in a mining event periodicity
from incomplete observations.

76
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:39,290
So in this whole session,
we discussed a few interesting issues.

77
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:46,170
We studied Mining Spatial Associations,
Mining Spatial Colocation Patterns,

78
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,800
Mining and Aggregating Patterns
over Multiple Trajectories,

79
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,600
Mining Semantics-Rich Movement Patterns
and Mining Periodic Movement Patterns.

80
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,385
In this session we actually used
the following research papers.

81
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:04,937
If you would like to know more,

82
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:09,758
we strongly encourage you to
read those research papers.

83
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:11,316
Thank you.
