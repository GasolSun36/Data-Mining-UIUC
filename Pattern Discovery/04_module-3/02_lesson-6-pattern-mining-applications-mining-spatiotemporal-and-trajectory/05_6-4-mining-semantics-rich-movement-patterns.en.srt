1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,798
Now, we study another
interesting movement pattern

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:12,016
called Mining Semantics-Rich
Movement Patterns.

3
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:15,630
We'll first see what is
Frequent Movement Pattern?

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,440
Frequent Movement Pattern is
a movement sequence, frequently appears

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,114
in the input trajectory database, but
we care more on the semantics here.

6
00:00:28,114 --> 00:00:31,820
For example,
from home to Starbucks to office.

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,732
So maybe people, the home maybe different
or office maybe different location,

8
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:44,732
but this pattern maybe interesting,
even we can consider the home and

9
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:50,746
office could be just the same semantic
units in different locations.

10
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:55,288
So comparing to
Frequent Movement Pattern versus

11
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:59,288
Frequent Sequential Pattern, we can say,

12
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:06,547
they both are at finding frequent
subsequences from input sequence database.

13
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:10,051
However, for
mining frequent movement patterns,

14
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:14,748
we would like to think of similar
places may need to be grouped together

15
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:20,020
collectively to form frequent subsequences
from the semantic point of view.

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,070
Now, we look at
Mining Semantics-Rich Movement Patterns.

17
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,280
The semantics-rich patterns means in
addition to know how people move from

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,890
one region to another, we want to also
understand the functions of the regions.

19
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,890
That means we want them see people
moving from office to restaurant or

20
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,900
from home to gym.

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,990
So, we promote a two-step
top-down mining approach.

22
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,742
The first step is try to find
a set of a coarse patterns that

23
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:59,900
reflects people semantic
level transitions.

24
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:06,353
That means as long as a reaching
carry the similar semantic functions,

25
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:12,173
we may one to consider they
are the same function or same entity.

26
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:17,224
Then in the step two,
we split each coarse pattern into several

27
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:23,570
fine-grained ones by grouping
similar movement snippets together.

28
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:29,039
This time, we'll consider spatial,
temporal, besides the semantics.

29
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,170
We're going to consider spatial and
temporal features more seriously.

30
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,586
A recent study published in
VLDB 2014 called Splitter,

31
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:43,728
Mining Fine-Grained Sequential Patterns in

32
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:49,790
Semantic Trajectories is an interesting
study in this direction.
