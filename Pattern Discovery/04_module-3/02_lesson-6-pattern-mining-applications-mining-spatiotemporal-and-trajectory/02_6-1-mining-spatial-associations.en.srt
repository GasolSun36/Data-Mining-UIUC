1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,650
When first studying
Mining Spatial Associations.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,100
Spatial association or
spatial frequent patterns share some

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,810
commonalities as a general association and
frequent patterns.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,580
For example, the association rules
are also in the form of A in plus B,

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,810
with certain support and a confidence.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:33,060
In this context, A and B could be sets
of spatial or non--spatial predicates.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,730
The spatial predicates may indicate
topological relations or spatial

8
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,460
orientations or distance information
like close to, within certain distance.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,570
And it measures support and confidence
are very similar to the general ones.

10
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,000
The rules with him find
it could be like if x

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,220
is a large town then x
intersect with the highway,

12
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,310
then x is likely to be adjacent to water.

13
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,710
Like lakes and the rivers and ocean so

14
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,800
that with certain support and
a confidence.

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,536
In spatial rail mining,
quite often we would like to explore

16
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,420
spatial autocorrelation.

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,610
That means spatial data tends
to be highly self-correlated,

18
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,700
nearby things are more related
than the remote things.

19
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,520
For example when we study neighborhood,
study temperature, likely would pay more

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,570
attention to find interesting
relationship in the nearby objects.

21
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,120
In spatial association mining,

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,450
there's a interesting heuristic
called progressive refinement.

23
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,520
The general philosophy of this for
a spatial relationship, there are some

24
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,530
rough ones like close to which is
generalization of some more refined one

25
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,710
like nearby, touch, intersect, contain,
they are somewhat or close to.

26
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,110
Just give you an example.

27
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,770
Like here, if we can see,
near a highway intersection,

28
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,180
you may be able to find shopping
centers and gas stations.

29
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,230
But how close to,
whether they are very nearby or

30
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,940
they are almost touch
the highway intersection.

31
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,070
So in that sense,
those are detail refine relationships.

32
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:40,470
However, if we first find those close
to there frequent together, okay.

33
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,660
Then we,
if we want to find the more refine,

34
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,540
how close to are they
really to the intersection.

35
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,310
So we can say if the close
to is a frequent pattern,

36
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,180
then we are going to study
the more refined watch.

37
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,880
To that extent, this is the philosophy
of progressive refinement.

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,300
That means, we first search for
rough relationships, and

39
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,220
then refine for,
to study more refined relationships.

40
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:16,730
The general philosophy is,
if the rough relationship is not frequent.

41
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,580
So there's no need to study the very final
because they are not frequent as well.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,840
So to that extent, we can do two
step mining of spatial association.

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,850
The first step, as we use and
we shape or low cost algorithm.

44
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,440
Like minimum bounding rectangle or
R-trees for some rough pattern mining.

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,250
That means we first compute
the rough spatial frequent patterns.

46
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,060
Then we know if the rough one is frequent,

47
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,500
then we are going to get
into refinement process.

48
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,870
That means we may study
a more detailed algorithm

49
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,970
using more refined data structure.

50
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,310
So this principle can save
a lot of mining cost.

51
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:12,020
Because we first using rough lines,
we get a big filter.

52
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,130
A lot of unnecessary pairs because
they are not frequent already.

53
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,300
We don't have to refine it.

54
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,139
We don't have to use a refine measure
to study more refined patterns.

55
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:32,680
Close to, you can find
