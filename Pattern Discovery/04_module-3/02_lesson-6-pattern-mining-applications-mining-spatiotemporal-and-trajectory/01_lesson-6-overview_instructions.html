  Lesson 6: Pattern Mining Applications: Mining Spatiotemporal and Trajectory Patterns
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Lesson Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this lesson, we will study concepts and methods for mining spatiotemporal and trajectory patterns as one kind of pattern mining application.   We will introduce a few popular kinds of patterns and their mining methods, including mining spatial associations, mining spatial colocation patterns, mining and aggregating patterns over multiple trajectories, mining semantics-rich movement patterns, and mining periodic movement patterns.

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Know that pattern mining has broad applications, and mining spatiotemporal and trajectory patterns is just one kind of pattern mining application.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Learn the concept of spatial association and learn the major heuristic for efficient spatial association mining.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Learn the concept of spatial colocation pattern and the major methodology for mining spatial colocation patterns.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Learn the concepts and methods for mining and aggregating patterns over multiple trajectories, especially methods for mining trajectory patterns (t-patterns), mining moving object clusters, and trajectory clustering.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Learn the methods for mining semantics-rich movement patterns and mining periodic movement patterns.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while watching the video lectures throughout the lesson.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Why do we need to mine spatiotemporal and trajectory patterns in many applications?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What are spatial associations and what are the key ideas to make such mining effective and efficient?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What are spatial colocation patterns and what are the differences between spatial association patterns and spatial co-location patterns?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When there exist multiple trajectories, what are the meaningful patterns we want to mine?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is swarm a more flexible definition than flock and convoy?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is partition-and-group framework more effective in trajectory clustering?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How can we capture more semantics in mining movement patterns?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why do we claim data can be still sparse in many movement datasets?  How can we uncover periodic movements from very sparse movement datasets?
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this lesson, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
