  Lesson 2: Efficient Pattern Mining Methods
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Lesson Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this lesson, we will learn the downward closure (or Apriori) property of frequent patterns and three major categories of methods for mining frequent patterns. First, we will introduce the most popular Apriori algorithm and understand why it is efficient in mining massive data sets.  This is followed by some extensions of the Apriori algorithm.  Second, we will introduce the second methodology, ECLAT, which explores vertical data format in mining.   Third, we will introduce the third methodology, the pattern-growth approach, represented by FPGrowth.  Finally, we will examine how to mine closed frequent patterns by introducing some ideas of Closet+.
