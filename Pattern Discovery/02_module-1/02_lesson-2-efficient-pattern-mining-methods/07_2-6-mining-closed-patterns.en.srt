Hi! In this final session of this lecture we're going to discuss mining closed pattern.

2
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,024
As we already know before,

3
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:23,359
closed pattern is a compact form but it's a last less compression of frequent patterns.

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,690
So mining this closed itemsets,

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,329
it's very interesting and useful.

6
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,479
And with pattern-growth approach there's

7
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,729
one interesting method developed called 'Closet+'.

8
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,774
Let's look at this 'Closet+'.

9
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:44,079
How to develop efficient directly mining of closed itemsets.

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,545
So let's look at this transaction database,

11
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:51,450
it contains only four transactions and these are the items in these transactions.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,155
Suppose the minimum support is two,

13
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:58,335
we'll be able to get these as frequent itemsets.

14
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:03,490
And based on this we can work out the F-list like the following.

15
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:10,045
Now, we look at an interesting method developed called 'itemset merging'.

16
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:13,974
The philosophy can be represented using this example.

17
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:17,349
Let's look at these projective database.

18
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:19,954
For these projective database,

19
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,034
we will have ACF,

20
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:25,625
EF, and ACF based on this.

21
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:30,379
As you can see this project database will get ACEF and ACF.

22
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:37,405
But the interesting thing is ACF happens in every transaction project in this database.

23
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:41,829
ACF have the same support as D. In that case,

24
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:45,144
we can grab ACF out form

25
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:51,640
ACFD project database which contains only one item E, it is not frequent.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,999
Therefore, we will be able to get a ACFD support is two, it's the final result.

27
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:06,834
This method called 'itemset merging' simply says if Y appears in every occurrence of X,

28
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:10,370
then items of Y is merged with X.

29
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,004
Now, the X is D and a Y is ACF.

30
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:20,275
ECF occurs in every occurrence of X which is D,

31
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:26,405
then we will merge ACFD together to form a more compressed form.

32
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:30,044
That means, you can mine all these immediately.

33
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:32,719
So this is more efficient.

34
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,280
Actually, there are many tricks developed in Closet+.

35
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,949
For example, hybrid tree projection,

36
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:41,495
we use bottom-up physical tree projection,

37
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,634
top-down pseudo tree projection.

38
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:47,679
There's one technical sub-itemset pruning,

39
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:51,460
itemset skipping, efficient subset testing.

40
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,979
But I'm not going to get into the details.

41
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:56,849
For details, you can read this paper.

42
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,384
So finally I'll summarize the recommended readings.

43
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:06,294
These are all classical papers.

44
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:13,979
Apriori mining and the further improvement of Apriori mining.

45
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:16,104
Then we have vertical methods,

46
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:21,115
FP-growth methods, and we have Closet+ methods.

47
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:22,840
So finally, there is

48
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,620
an interesting survey article called 'Frequent Pattern Mining Algorithms',

49
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,405
which contain many more algorithms covered in this lecture.

50
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:34,074
