  Lesson 1: Pattern Discovery Basic Concepts
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Lesson Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this lesson, you will learn the general concepts of pattern discovery. We will introduce the basic concepts of frequent patterns, closed patterns, max-patterns, and association rules.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Time
 </h2>
 <p>
  This lesson should take
  <strong>
   approximately 2 hours
  </strong>
  of dedicated time to complete, with its videos and assignments.

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand what pattern discovery is, and why it is useful and important in many applications.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand the basic concepts of frequent patterns and association rules, including the basic measures such as support and confidence.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Understand why compressed representation of frequent patterns is an interesting idea, and what the differences are between two popular compressed representations: closed patterns and max-patterns.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while watching the video lectures throughout the lesson.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is pattern discovery an important task in data mining?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What are the concepts of frequent itemsets?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What are the concepts of association rules? How do you generate association rules from frequent itemsets?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why do we need compressed representations of frequent patterns?  Why do we need two compression representations: closed patterns and max-patterns?
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this lesson, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
