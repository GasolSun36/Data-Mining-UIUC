00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,360
Let's first introduce some basic concepts: frequent patterns and association rules.

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,965
We first look at this simple transaction example.

3
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:19,025
There are five transactions,

4
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:22,450
10 to 50 are the transaction IDs,

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,700
and these are the sets of items they bought.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,680
For example, transaction ID 10 contains beer,

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,785
nuts and diaper, which form an itemset because it is a set of items.

8
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,940
And, for this particular line,

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,165
it is 3-itemset because it contains three items.

10
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:44,804
And for each itemset,

11
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:49,105
you may have a concept of support.

12
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:53,320
Support means, in this transaction dataset,

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,520
how many times beer happens.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,674
In this particular case,

15
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:03,389
there are three occurrences of beers in this transaction data,

16
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:06,889
so this support count of beer is three.

17
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:09,809
But you also can use relative support;

18
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:13,110
that means the fraction of the transactions.

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,920
For example, there are a total of five transactions,

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,230
three of them contains beers,

21
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,850
so the relative support is 3/5 or you can say 60 percent.

22
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:32,070
So, we may see whether an itemset X is frequent or not if X,

23
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,915
the support of X,

24
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:36,749
pass a minimum support threshold.

25
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:41,160
For example, if we set the minimum support threshold is 50 percent,

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,539
then we can see the frequent 1-itemset in this datasets,

27
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,185
you will find they're four.

28
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:52,396
Like beer, you can see they're three cases,

29
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:54,734
this absolute support is three,

30
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:58,545
the relative support is 3/5, is 60 percent.

31
00:01:58,545 --> 00:02:01,875
OK. But for frequent 2-itemsets,

32
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,204
you may check it.

33
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:04,988
There's only one.

34
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:07,775
OK. Because it's a beer and diaper,

35
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:11,804
they happen together 3/5,

36
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:13,650
that's why we get this.

37
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,995
But none of the other, you know,

38
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:21,304
itemsets they pass this 50 percent threshold,

39
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:23,235
so there's only one.

40
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:26,010
And from the frequent itemsets,

41
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,676
we can introduce an interesting rule,

42
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:33,345
association rule that implies,

43
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:40,220
for example, X implies Y simply says if people are buying X,

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:47,210
what is the support and confidence people will buy the itemset Y?

45
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,940
OK, then S is the support,

46
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:56,795
which is a probability X and Y contained together in this rule set.

47
00:02:56,795 --> 00:03:00,029
OK. Then c is a confidence,

48
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,605
which is conditional probability.

49
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:05,645
That means if the transaction contains X,

50
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:10,349
what is the probability it also contains Y?

51
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,145
So, for this probabilistic computation,

52
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:17,740
you can use support X union Y divided by support X.

53
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,314
That means take the whole rule support,

54
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,805
divide by the left-hand side.

55
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:27,700
You may see this notion X union Y.

56
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,390
This is a set union.

57
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,715
But if you look at the Venn diagram,

58
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:39,002
actually transactions containing X could be this part; transaction containing diaper,

59
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:41,676
like beer, is this part of diaper, is this part;

60
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:45,260
containing both actually is their intersection,

61
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,395
OK, the intersection of the events.

62
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,610
OK. But from the itemset point of view,

63
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,560
X is the transactions containing both X and Y,

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,970
both beer and diaper.

65
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,950
You will say this one were count,

66
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:07,280
that's why we use not X intersects Y but X union Y. OK.

67
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,385
If you think X is beer, Y is diaper,

68
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:13,682
X intersects Y will be empty,

69
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:17,154
X union Y means it contains both.

70
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:21,830
Then, for association rule mining is actually try to

71
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:27,464
find all such rules which pass a minimum support and a confidence threshold.

72
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:32,045
We already know if we set minimum support is 0.5,

73
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:35,915
we're find these are the frequent 1-itemsets,

74
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:38,405
these are the frequent 2-itemsets.

75
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:43,700
From here, if we set minimum confidence is 50 percent,

76
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,255
we're going to derive two association rules.

77
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,140
Because these two rules,

78
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,000
if you use this computation,

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,810
beer and diaper getting together is three,

80
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,815
in here, then it's 60 percent because 3/5.

81
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:05,989
Then, if every time beer occurs,

82
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:07,820
you can see diaper also occur.

83
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,595
That's why the confidence is 100 percent.

84
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:13,534
But for diaper implies beer,

85
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:17,000
you can see the diaper support is four,

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,079
beer support is three,

87
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,375
so that means there's only 75 percent of

88
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:30,320
probability the customer buying a diaper likely will buy beer.

89
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,969
Are there more rules in this one?

90
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:34,920
Actually if you check this,

91
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,109
because this is only frequent 2-itemset,

92
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:45,960
these two are the only associated rules that can be generated from this transaction data.
