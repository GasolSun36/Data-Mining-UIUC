00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:11,000
[SOUND] The first session we're going
to discuss, what is Pattern Discovery.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,450
Why it is important?

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,730
To know why pattern
discovery is important,

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,370
we need to know what are the patterns.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,880
Okay.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,110
Patterns, actually are a set of
items subsequences or substructures

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,243
that occur frequently together in a data
set we call this strongly correlated.

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,540
Patterns usually represent intrinsic and
important properties of data.

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:44,315
That's why Pattern Discovery is
the process try to uncover, try to mind

10
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:49,620
patterns from massive data sets,
it has many interesting applications.

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,160
For example, in transaction
database you may want to find

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,060
what kind of products
are often purchased together?

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,450
Now you can do some target marketing.

14
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:09,330
And for customers, you may want to
study if a person buying an iPad,

15
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,390
what are likely other products he or
she is going to buy in the future?

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,300
And even for software engineering,
you may want,

17
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,619
based on a co second analysis,
to try to find copy-and-paste bugs.

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,150
For text analysis,
you may want to see what are likely

19
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,280
the keywords were from phrases, finding
phrases may need pattern mining as well.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,550
We can see Pattern Discovery could
be very important because it

21
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,200
is uncover inherent
regularities in the data sets.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,610
It forms the foundation for many things.

23
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,860
For example, association, correlation, and

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,820
causality analysis,
mining sequential structure patterns,

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,960
pattern analysis is spatiotemporal data,
multimedia data and stream data.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,785
Even for classification,
ff we use discriminative native

27
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:11,320
pattern-based analysis,
the classification could be more accurate.

28
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,330
And for cluster analysis,
pattern-based subspace clustering

29
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,710
could be an important direction for
cluster analysis.

30
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,452
So there's no wonder why we want
to study Pattern Discovery.

31
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:36,452
