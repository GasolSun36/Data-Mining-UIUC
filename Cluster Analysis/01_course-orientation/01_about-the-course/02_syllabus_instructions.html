  Course Description
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this course you will learn concepts and methodologies for cluster analysis, which is also known as clustering, data segmentation, or unsupervised learning.  Cluster analysis is an important subfield of data mining.  We will introduce the basic concepts of cluster analysis and then study a set of typical clustering methodologies, algorithms, and applications. This includes partitioning methods such as k-means, hierarchical methods such as BIRCH, density-based methods such as DBSCAN, and grid-based methods such as CLIQUE.  We will also discuss methods for clustering validation.  The learning will be enhanced by some clustering software and some programming assignments.

  Course Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Recall basic concepts, methods, and applications of cluster analysis, including the concept of clustering, the requirements and challenges of cluster analysis, a multi-dimensional categorization of cluster analysis, and an overview of typical clustering methodologies
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Learn multiple distance or similarity measures for cluster analysis, including Euclidean and Minkowski Distances, proximity measures for symmetric and asymmetric binary variables, distance measures between categorical attributes, ordinal attributes, and mixed types, proximity measures between two vectors, Cosine similarity, and correlation measures between two variables: covariance and correlation coefficient
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Learn popular distance-based partitioning algorithms for cluster analysis, including K-Means, K-Medians, K-Medoids, and the Kernel K-Means algorithms

  Elements of This Course
 </h2>
 <p>
  The course is comprised of the following elements:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Lecture videos.
    </strong>
    Each week your instructor will teach you the concepts you need to know through a collection of short video lectures. You may either stream these videos for playback within the browser by clicking on their titles, or you can download each video for later offline playback by clicking the download icon.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     In-video questions
    </strong>
    . Some lectures have questions associated with them to help verify your understanding of the topics. These questions will automatically appear while watching the video if you stream the video through your browser. The questions are available as a separate downloadable text file for those who prefer to download the videos. These questions do not contribute toward your final score in the class.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Lesson Quizzes

   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Programming Assignments.
    </strong>
    There are two required programming assignments for this class. The first programming assigmment is about implementing the K-means clustering algorithm, and the second programming assignment is about implementing clustering validation measures.
    <strong>
     Both programming assignments are required for the Course Certificate
