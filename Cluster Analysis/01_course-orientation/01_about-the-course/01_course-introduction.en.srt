Hi

2
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:11,010
welcome to the course,
Cluster Analysis in Data Mining.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,470
Before starting this course, I'm going
to give you a general course overview.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,200
First, what is cluster analysis?

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,550
Actually when you fly over a city,
you can easily identify fields,

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,030
forests, commercial area, and
residential areas based on their features,

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,610
without anybody's explicit training or
labeling.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,430
This is the power of cluster analysis.

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,260
In this course,
I'm going to systematically

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,450
introduce you the concepts and
methods of cluster analysis.

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,420
And help answering the following question.

12
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,760
What are the different proximity
measures for effective clustering?

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,170
Can we cluster a massive number
of data points efficiently?

14
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:10,480
Can we find clusters of arbitrary shape
and at multilevels of granularity?

15
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,210
How can we judge the quality of
the clusters discovered by our system?

16
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,790
Cluster analysis bring a lot
of value to data mining.

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,680
What is the value of cluster analysis?

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,960
Cluster analysis may help you partition

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,930
massive data into groups
based on its features.

20
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,210
Cluster analysis also will help
subsequent data mining processes,

21
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,900
such a pattern discovery,
classification and outlier analysis.

22
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,990
What roles does cluster analysis play
in the data mining specialization?

23
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:58,238
You will learn various scalable methods
to find clusters from massive data.

24
00:01:58,238 --> 00:02:03,390
You will learn how to mine different
kinds of clusters effectively.

25
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,020
You'll also learn how to evaluate
the quality of the clusters you'll find.

26
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,980
And you will see cluster analysis
will help with classification,

27
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,030
outlier analysis and
other data mining tasks.

28
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,721
Cluster analysis has
its broad applications.

29
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:27,007
For example, for data summarization,
compression, and reduction, like

30
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:32,310
image processing or vector quantization,
you will need cluster analysis.

31
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,900
For collaborative filtering,
recommendation systems, or

32
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,551
customer segmentation,
you will find like-minded

33
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:47,600
users or
similar products by cluster analysis.

34
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,520
For dynamic trend detection,
you will find clustering stream data and

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,779
detecting trends and
patterns will be very effective.

36
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,850
For multimedia analysis,
biological data analysis, and

37
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,130
social network analysis you'll
find you may have effecting

38
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,920
measures to group audio/video clips and

39
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,660
finding clusters of
gene protein sequences.

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,400
Cluster analysis is a key intermediate
step for many other data mining tasks.

41
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,780
For example, you want to generate
a compact summary of data for

42
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,220
classification, pattern discovery,
hypothesis generation and

43
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,420
testing your neat cluster masses.

44
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,640
You wana find outlier detection.

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,417
Actually, outliers are those
far away from any cluster.

46
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:50,321
In this course,
the major reference of the readings is

47
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:54,905
my own textbook published in 2011,
which is,

48
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:58,637
Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques,

49
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:03,240
the 3rd edition,
published by Morgan Kaufmann.

50
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,420
In this book,
we will only used two chapters.

51
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,555
The first is Chapter 2.

52
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:15,010
[INAUDIBLE] just cover

53
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,760
section 2.4: Measuring Data Similarity and
dissimilarity.

54
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:27,710
And then Chapter 4 is a major
source related to this textbook.

55
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,210
The textbook of Chapter 4 is a major
source related to this seminar,

56
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,330
this lecture, called Cluster
Analysis: Basic Concepts and Methods.

57
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,110
Other references will be listed
at the end of each lecture video.

58
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,370
For the course structure,
we will have six lessons.

59
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,450
Lesson 1 is,
Cluster Analysis: An Introduction.

60
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,200
Lesson 2 is, Similarity Measures for
Cluster Analysis.

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,456
These two lessons from the first module,
Module 1.

62
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:11,058
Then, Lesson 3:
Partitioning-Based Clustering Methods.

63
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:18,053
An, Lesson 4(Part
I): Hierarchical Clustering Methods (I),

64
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:21,258
from the contents of Module 2.

65
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:27,890
Then the Part II of Lesson 2,
Hierarchical Clustering Methods (II).

66
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,855
And, Lesson 5: Density-Based and

67
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:36,144
Grid-Based Clustering Methods,
form the contents of Module 3.

68
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,803
Finally, Lesson 6: Clustering Validation,

69
00:05:42,803 --> 00:05:46,688
forms the material for Module 4.

70
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:51,200
For general information about this course,
I'm Jiawei Han.

71
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,960
I'm a professor in the Department
of Computer Science,

72
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,850
University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign.

73
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,594
I'm the instructor.

74
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:04,590
We have some teaching assistants
on the web to help you.

75
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,128
The course prerequisites.

76
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:11,690
Just as long as you are familiar
with basic data structure and

77
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,080
algorithms, you like to work hard,
you're quite okay.

78
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,830
For course assessments,
we have in-video questions to

79
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,840
help you understand the course materials.

80
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,460
Then we need you to pass some
minimum requirements for

81
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:37,200
lesson quizzes and
two programming assignments.

82
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,070
Thank you.

83
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,970
Hope you will enjoy this course.

84
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,470
Thank you.

85
