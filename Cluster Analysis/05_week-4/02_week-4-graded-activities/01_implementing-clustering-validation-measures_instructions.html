 <p>
  In this assignment, you will be implementing two clustering validation measures: Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Jaccard similarity.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be given one ground-truth clustering (partition) results and five clustering test cases.  You need to evaluate the clustering test cases with regard to the ground-truth by NMI and Jaccard measures and submit your measures.  You will be graded based on whether your measures are correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ground-truth clustering (partition) results are stored in file "partitions.txt"; the five clustering result test cases are stored in file "clustering_1.txt", ..., "clustering_5.txt".
 </p>
 <p>
  All files including partitions.txt, clustering_1.txt, ..., can be downloaded from the data.zip file attached below.
 </p>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="zip" id="oIqelIs3Eea63BLi-G7oTw" name="data">
 </asset>
 <p>
  Each clustering result (both ground-truth and test cases) is represented by a file.  Each line in a file consists of two integers, separated by a space.  The first integer represents the id of a data item, and the second integer represents the id of the cluster which this item belongs to.
 </p>
 <p>
  You need to submit a file titled "scores.txt" consisting of 5 lines.  Each line contains two float numbers separated by a space.  The first number of the i-th line represents the NMI measure you calculated for the i-th test case i (i.e. "clustering_i.txt") with regard to the ground-truth given in "partitions.txt", and the second number of the i-th line represents the Jaccard measure you calculated for the i-th test case.
 </p>
 <p>
  As an example, a valid submission may look like:
 </p>
 <pre>0.1000000 0.2000000
0.3000000 0.4000000
0.5000000 0.6000000
0.7000000 0.8000000
0.9000000 1.0000000</pre>
 <p>
  You will be graded based on whether your file format is correct and onhow many measures you submitted are correct.
