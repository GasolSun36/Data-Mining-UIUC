00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:07,140
Hi!

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,840
In this session we are going
to discuss the first group

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,346
of external measures called
matching-based measures.

5
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:22,630
For matching-based measures we will first
introduce purity versus maximum matching.

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,798
We still use a similar notation,

7
00:00:24,798 --> 00:00:29,000
suppose we have ground truth
we get three categories.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,390
T1 actually marked as the brown points.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,750
T2 marked as a green points.

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,760
T3 marked as black points.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,660
These are the ground truths.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,036
Then the clustering we finally got is,
cluster C sub 1,

13
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:53,200
actually it's marked as the ellipse
of the orange color, okay.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,190
C2 marked as surrounded by the red color.

15
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,425
And C3 is surrounded by the black color.

16
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,670
So what is a purity?

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,448
Actually quantifies the extent
that cluster C sub i contains

18
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:16,270
the points only from one
ground truth's partition.

19
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,060
Suppose we have R clusters
the finer we get.

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,150
So for purity sub i actually
is you first count how many

21
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,700
points in this cluster then
you try to see the maximum

22
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,690
number of the ground truths here.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,510
The maximum number of ground truths
actually is the black points.

24
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,360
You will see the max number is one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven.

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,510
So you get this one seven,
but the total number is nine,

26
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,320
so you get a purity of seven over nine,
okay.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,290
Then what is the total purity
of the whole clustering, C?

28
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,680
Essentially this total purity is,
each one's purity.

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,620
Suppose you have R clusters.

30
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,920
Each one's purity get their
corresponding proportion.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,480
So you add them together,
so that's the total purity.

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,870
Or you can transform this formula
easily into this one, okay.

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,910
Of course, the perfect clustering is
in the case when the purity is one,

34
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,410
that means everything is very pure,
you add them together, it's one.

35
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,450
And the number of clusters
you obtained is the same

36
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,790
as the number of groups
in the ground truths.

37
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,200
Then we look at these two tables.

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,400
Let's first look at the green table.

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
The green table, the purity 1.

40
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,070
That means the first cluster,
you get a maximum of 30.

41
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,260
So the purity is 30 over
the total number of points.

42
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,793
It's 50 so you get 30 / 50.

43
00:02:56,793 --> 00:03:00,657
Purity 2, obviously you get 20 / 25.

44
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:04,890
Then purity 3 is 25 / 25, it's really 1.

45
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,260
Then the total purity for

46
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,513
the whole clustering is, according to
this formula, we'll get a maximum y is

47
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:18,694
(30 + 20 + 25) over the total
number of points, you get 0.75.

48
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,337
Interestingly, if you look at
the orange table, orange colored table,

49
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:30,946
you will get the exact number of the same
thing is 30 over 50, 20 over 25,

50
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:36,000
25 over 25 and finally to get
the purity is exactly the same formula.

51
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,630
But you may find one undesirable thing for

52
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,930
this orange colored table
because if you can see,

53
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,910
the ground truth T2 total we get 50,
the actual

54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,820
was partitioned into two clusters,
C1 and C2.

55
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,620
That means both C1 and C2 would say,
we belong to ground truth T2.

56
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:08,190
But on the green table you
probably can see, it's different,

57
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,510
because C1 more pair with T3 and
C2 more pair with T2.

58
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,960
So that motivates people
proposed maximum matching.

59
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,530
That means one cluster can
only match to one partition.

60
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,830
If we have this rule then we have
to find a pairwise matching.

61
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,927
That means when we look at this we look
at the weight, we will allow these

62
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:39,690
element only belong to one cluster.

63
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,656
The ij and ij.

64
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:46,380
The ij must be exactly the same then

65
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,450
if this element belonged to M
then it only belonged to one.

66
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,100
So then we need to look at the what
is maximum weight matching.

67
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,100
The maximum weight matching simply
says you look at the whole group and

68
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,510
then you look at all over n points

69
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,810
you try to find the final matching
together should be maximized.

70
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,360
For example if you look at a green one the
max matching is 30 parting into T3, T2,

71
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,950
pairwise with C2, and
T1 pairwise with C3, okay.

72
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,790
That's why green's maximum matching
is equal to purity is 0.75.

73
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:34,196
However, for this orange color table,

74
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:40,570
you probably can see is
if you assign T2 to C1.

75
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,420
Then you can assign T2 to C2
then you have to assign T3 to C2

76
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,570
then finally you get this matching 0.6.

77
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,396
However if you assign, T3 to C1, T2 to C2,

78
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:57,982
T1 to C3 you will get matching as 0.65 to

79
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:02,692
that extent this assignment
is better because

80
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:07,970
the maximum matching, the value is bigger.

81
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,690
So that's the reason for the maximum
matching, you do have restriction,

82
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,557
you have the pairwise assignment.

83
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:22,634
Then, another popular use matching-based
measure called F-measure.

84
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:27,078
F-measure has been very popularly
used in information retrieval.

85
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:31,180
F-measure is essentially
computed by precision and

86
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,640
recall, let's look at how
the precisioning is defined, okay.

87
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,530
The precision define is for this
particular matching what you want to see

88
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,630
is for
precision T sub i what you want to find is

89
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:51,040
what's a maximum y matching this
particular cluster then divide

90
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,050
by the number of total number
of points in this cluster so

91
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:03,377
in that sense your precision
actually is the same as purity.

92
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:11,586
That means if you get a fraction of C sub
i from the majority partition of C sub j.

93
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:16,450
Then the j's partition
contains a max number of

94
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,076
points from C sub i then
you get this formula.

95
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:24,963
For this formula,
you get this the precision and the purity,

96
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,923
actually this one is the same.

97
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:33,417
You will get 30/50, 20/25 and 25/25.

98
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:38,850
Okay, that's the precision,
what about recall?

99
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,415
Recall actually is the fraction
of the points in the partition

100
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:47,210
shared in common with cluster C sub i.

101
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,503
Simply says, if you assign T3 to C1,

102
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:56,058
what you want to see
is you've got a 30 but

103
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:01,935
T3 actually got 35 granted
you only capture 30.

104
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:06,060
That means you're recall is 30 over 35.

105
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,290
That's exactly,
you probably can see the formula.

106
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,990
Similarly, for
the second partition if you assign

107
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,251
ground truths T2 to C2,
what you can see is,

108
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:23,320
you only get 20/40 so
your recall is 20/40.

109
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,189
Similarly for
the third one when you assign

110
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,740
the ground truth of T1
to C3 you get 25/25.

111
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,660
That means the fraction of the point
in this partition share in

112
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,740
common with the cluster C sub i,
then you get this recall.

113
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,080
Now what about an F measure?

114
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,270
F measure actually is a harmonic
means of precision and recall.

115
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,370
So F measure for
a cluster C sub i is the harmonic

116
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,910
means of precision sub i and recall sub i.

117
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,280
If you transform the formula
will become like this one.

118
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,090
Then for F measure for
the whole clustering.

119
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:12,220
What you need is you just need to
average all the clusters the F measures,

120
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,773
that means supposed you get r clusters
then you will get F measure from 1 to r.

121
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:22,528
You add them together divided by r, okay.

122
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,941
So for
this green table what you can see is,

123
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:32,703
where you get F1 is because
you got 2 times 30 divided

124
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:37,620
by total is these two
add together you get 85.

125
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:45,820
Then for F2 you get 2 times 20 divided
by these two adding together, okay.

126
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,570
F3 of course is 1,
no matter what you calculate it.

127
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,190
Then you average all these three.

128
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,991
You get F-measure this number.

129
00:09:54,991 --> 00:10:04,991
