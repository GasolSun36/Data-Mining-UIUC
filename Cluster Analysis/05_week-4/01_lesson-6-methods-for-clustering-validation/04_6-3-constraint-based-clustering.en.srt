1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,550
[SOUND] In this session,
we will give a general

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,363
introduction on External Measures for

3
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:13,586
Clustering Validation.

4
00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:16,680
We know clustering is unsupervised.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,530
In this sense,
we really want to use some good judgement.

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:27,450
External methods is to give some
expert knowledge or some prior truths.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,040
So to that extent,
we call these as ground truth T.

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:38,060
So given ground truth T, then we want
to measure the quality of clustering C,

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,929
we use the quality measure Q(C, T).

10
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:48,980
The function Q(CT) is good if it satisfies
the following four essential criteria.

11
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,280
The first one called cluster homogeneity.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,800
That means we want the cluster
formed to be pure.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,060
That means they're in the same cluster.

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,240
So, the purer the better, of course.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,900
The second one,
called clustering completeness.

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,810
That means we want to assign objects
belonging to the same category in

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,600
the ground truth to the same cluster.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,350
That means you may get all
these object are a category a,

19
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,060
but you assign them to two,
to three clusters.

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,160
That's no good.

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,630
We want to be complete.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,400
The third on is rag bag better than alien.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,203
Simply says,
you may have some heterogeneous object.

24
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:34,610
'Kay.
If you put them into a pure cluster,

25
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,610
you mix the other category up.

26
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,120
That's no good.

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,200
You want to penalize this.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,900
It's better even to put
them into a rag bag.

29
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,550
Rag bag means it's in the miscellaneous or
other category.

30
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,280
It's better than you mix
up with some pure cluster.

31
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,370
Then the fourth measure of course,
small cluster preservation, simply says,

32
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,250
if you got a pretty small cluster already,
you do want to further split

33
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,450
them into pieces because those
pieces likely represent noises.

34
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:15,060
In that case, you better split
a larger category into smaller pieces.

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,980
The reason is, the larger category likely,
they may belong to different clusters,

36
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,810
or different other smaller categories.

37
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,450
That's small cluster preservation.

38
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,110
Then, we will see what we are going to
examine on those external measures.

39
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,340
We often use this graph, this color graph.

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,470
Those brown points,

41
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,360
this dark brown points, suppose they
are ground truth partitioning T1.

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,360
That means expert label
those points as T1, okay.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,070
Then the ground truth, the other ground
truth may be they labeled as blue one.

44
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,620
That means T2 dark blue one,
actually is another category.

45
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,710
'Kay.

46
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,080
That means for ground truth, for expert,

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,354
they know that different colors
belong to different truths.

48
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,620
'Kay.

49
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,820
However your clustering algorithm
may generate things circled by

50
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,040
the light brown one or
orange one, or the red one.

51
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,600
That means they are not ideal,
they may not be good enough for

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,510
the matching what expert judgement.

53
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,410
So, we want to measure whether
your clustering method is good.

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,190
'Kay.

55
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:39,638
So, the measure one we call
matching-based measure.

56
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:45,209
We, we have sev, several measures, like
purity, maximum matching, or F-measure.

57
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,800
Another kind of measure called
entropy-based measures.

58
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,880
There are conditional entropy,
normalized mutual information,

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,050
NMI, or variation of information.

60
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,489
The certain kind of measures
called pairwise measures.

61
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,440
For example,

62
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,950
we may have four possibilities,
true positive, false negative.

63
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,720
False positive, true negative.

64
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,270
Okay.

65
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,031
Then, we actually have
Jaccard coefficient,

66
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:22,080
Rand statistic, Fowlkes-Mallow measure.

67
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,992
The fourth category called
correlation measures.

68
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:30,961
Essentially, they
are discretized Huber static and

69
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,720
normalized discretized Huber static.

70
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,890
And those marked as to be covered.

71
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:44,753
We will discuss them in more
detail in the subsequent sessions.

72
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:54,753
