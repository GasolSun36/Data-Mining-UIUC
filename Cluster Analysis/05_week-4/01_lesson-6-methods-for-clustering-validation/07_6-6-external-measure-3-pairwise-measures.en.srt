1
00:00:06,163 --> 00:00:10,628
In this session, we're going to
introduce a certain kind of external

2
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:13,060
measures called pairwise measures.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,470
What are pairwise measures?

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,540
That means we take any two points.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,810
We see whether they agree between their
cluster label and a partition label.

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,640
So there are four possible cases for
any pairs.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,470
We have true positive, false negative,
false positive and true negative.

8
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,656
Then we look at the cases.

9
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:40,790
For example, you get any two
points x sub i and x sub j.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,040
If they belong to the same partition T and

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,070
they also in the same cluster C,
in that case, this is a true positive.

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,040
For example, we look at this case.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,959
The definition is the true positive
is a number of such cases, okay?

14
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,891
For example, for
any two points x sub i and x sub j,

15
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:06,453
if they have the same
true partition label and

16
00:01:06,453 --> 00:01:11,328
they also have the same cluster label,
that means they belong

17
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:16,635
to the same cluster,
then that's the case of true positive.

18
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:18,755
For example, we just look at this case.

19
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:23,725
For these two blue points,
they belong to the same

20
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:28,635
ground truth T2 and
also they belong to the same cluster C2.

21
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,895
That's true positive.

22
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:31,795
Okay.

23
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:33,550
Then what is false negative?

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,560
False negative means they have
the same ground-truth partition label,

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,420
but on the other hand they
are not in the same cluster.

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,960
For example,
you just look at these two brown points.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,650
They have the same ground-truth T1, but
they belong to different, clusters.

28
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,740
So that's the false negative case.

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,410
Well, what is false positive?

30
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:02,750
False positive means they actually
have different partition label,

31
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,510
but they are in the same cluster.

32
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,380
For example, just look at this
blue one and this brown one.

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,780
They actually do not have
the same partition label but

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,010
they are in the same cluster, okay.

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,630
What is true negative?

36
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,100
True negative pairs actually means
that they do not have the same

37
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,750
partition label but
they are also not in the same cluster.

38
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,350
For example, if you look at this
black one and this blue one.

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,170
These two points,
they do not have the same partition label,

40
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,440
but they are also not in the same cluster.

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,880
So that's a good case.

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,160
Then we see how we can
calculate the four measures.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:50,290
First, given n points in the data sets,
the possible pairs you need to examine,

44
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,370
actually the n chooses two, so
that's the reason you have this formula.

45
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,690
Then for the true positive case is
you get all the, the partitions and

46
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,600
the clusters, if they agree to each other,
that's the case you have n i j,

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,019
you choose any, these case you choose
any two, you get that many cases.

48
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,005
Then what is false negative?

49
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:22,060
False negative means you get
that many partition cases,

50
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,750
but they do not belong to
the true positive, okay.

51
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,380
What is false positive?

52
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,100
That means you have so
many clustering cases, but

53
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,315
they do not belong to the true positive.

54
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:34,463
Then what is true negative cases?

55
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:38,877
That means for all the cases,
they do not belong to any one of

56
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:42,866
the above three cases,
then they are true negative.

57
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:47,249
Okay, so that computation we can
just simply use those formulas.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,350
With the introduction of true positive,
false negative, these four measures, then

59
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,100
we can calculate other measures like the
Jaccard coefficient and Rand statistic.

60
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,840
Then, we still take this figure
as our illustrative example.

61
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,280
Then for Jaccard coefficient, remember we
define the Jaccard coefficient before.

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,530
And this one is the definition for
the pairwise measures.

63
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,480
And this Jaccard coefficient
have the similar kind of flavor.

64
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,730
You probably can see.

65
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,280
You have true positives divide by all
the cases except that you ignore the true

66
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,689
negative case, okay.

67
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,300
That means the fraction of
the true positive points, but

68
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,672
after ignoring the true negative cases.

69
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:38,130
Therefore, this computation, positive and

70
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,910
negative are different to the,
our asymmetric measure.

71
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,480
However, for perfect clustering Jaccard
coefficient should be one because,

72
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,850
you know,
all the cases you actually cover.

73
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,220
You don't have those false ca, cases.

74
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,650
For a Rand statistic is you
take all the true cases,

75
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:02,990
true positive plus true negative
divided by all the possible pairs.

76
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,310
Okay?

77
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,460
That means you don't cover
anything like a negative.

78
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,505
Okay?
That's why, if it's perfect clustering,

79
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:14,475
Rand statistic should be 1.

80
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,130
It is symmetrical because
you take a positive and

81
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,690
a negative case just, equally.

82
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:29,620
Then there is another interesting
measure called Fowlkes-Mallow measure.

83
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,740
This measure is a geometric
mean of precision and recall.

84
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,980
Remember we just studied F measure,

85
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,630
which is a harmonic mean of precision and
recall.

86
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,140
For geometric mean Fowlkes-Mallow measure,

87
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,130
essentially is precision times recall,
you get their square root.

88
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,010
And once we introduce all these measures,
if we wanted to calculate for

89
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,944
example any table like
this one this green table,

90
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:02,809
we can use this measure to
calculate all the numbers.

91
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:07,478
We will leave this
calculation as an exercise,

92
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:11,691
instead of spending time lecturing here.

93
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:21,691
