  Lesson 6: Methods for Clustering Validation
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this lesson, you will learn clustering validation methods.  We will introduce the basic concepts of clustering validation and discuss typical clustering validation measures.   We first introduce external measures, such as matching-based measures, entropy-based measures, and pairwise measures.  Then we introduce internal measures and relative measures for clustering validation.   We will also discuss how to evaluate cluster stability and clustering tendency.

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this lesson, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
