00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,211
[SOUND] Now we get into
clustering evaluation,

2
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:12,379
measuring clustering quality.

3
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:17,377
Measuring clustering quality is an
important issue just because clustering is

4
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:19,760
unsupervised measure.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,930
We want to evaluate the goodness
of clustering results

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,670
by either some internal or
external measures.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,480
Unfortunately there's no commonly
recognized best suitable measure

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,060
in practice.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,330
But there are three categories of
measures we call external measures,

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,030
internal measures and relative measures.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,930
For external measures,
we can consider they are supervised,

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,500
employ criteria not inherent
to the datasets itself.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,210
That means we may have some prior or
expert knowledge.

14
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,307
For example, some ground truth.

15
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:06,070
Then we can comparing the clustering
results against the prior or

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,830
expert specified knowledge,
using certain clustering quality measure.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,670
Then the second kinds of measure
are called internal measure,

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,540
which is unsupervised.

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,930
That means the criteria
derived from the data itself.

20
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,940
In that case, we will evaluate the
goodness of clustering by considering how

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,050
well the clusters are separated and
how compact the clusters are.

22
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,350
For example,
we can use silhouette coefficient.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,240
The third one is a relative measure.

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,050
That means we can directly compare
different class rings using

25
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,910
those obtained via different parameter
setting for the same algorithm.

26
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:55,470
For example, For the same algorithm,
we use different number of clusters.

27
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,100
We may generate different
clustering results.

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,294
We may want to compare those results to,
for example,

29
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:07,395
we can use silhouette
coefficient to see how nicely,

30
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:13,504
by setting a certain number of clusters,
the clusters are better separated and

31
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:17,334
you, within each cluster
they are more compact so

32
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:22,836
this is a relative measure to
comparing different parameter setting.

33
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:32,836
