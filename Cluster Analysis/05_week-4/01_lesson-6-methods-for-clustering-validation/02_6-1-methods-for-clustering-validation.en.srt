2
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:11,610
We first introduce some basic
concepts of clustering validation.

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,750
We know clustering is unsupervised method,

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,260
in the sense we do not have
any expert to judge whether

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,000
this clustering is good or
what should be clustered.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,378
So it is important to
evaluate clustering quality.

7
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:34,970
That means evaluating
the goodness of the clustering.

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,980
Also we want evaluate
clustering stability.

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,150
That means to understand the sensitivity
of the clustering results to various

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,590
algorithm parameters, for
example, the number of clusters.

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,860
That means, what number of clusters is
really good based on our evaluation.

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,550
The third one is clustering tendency.

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,200
That means whether it's
suitable to do clustering.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,995
That means whether the data has
inherent to grouping structure,

15
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:13,625
then we should, for
some kind of clustering, to discover it.
