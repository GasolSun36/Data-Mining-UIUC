1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:08,376
[SOUND] In this session, we are going to
introduce another kind of measures for

2
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:14,432
clustering validation called
the Relative Measures.

3
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:20,930
We already introduced external
measure when we have [INAUDIBLE].

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:27,100
We also introduced internal measure when
we try to measure the intro cluster,

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,330
they are very compact, and
inter cluster, they are far apart.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,540
Now, we want to look at
what is relative measure.

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,140
Relative measure actually is trying
to direct compare different clusters.

8
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:48,310
Especially for those obtained
using the same algorithm but

9
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,420
different parameter setting.

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,680
For example, like if we all use k-means
to cluster a group of things but

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,071
in that case, we want to measure for
different cluster instantiation.

12
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:07,785
Which one gave you the best clustering or
a different case for

13
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:13,745
k from one to certain number,
which k gives you the best clustering.

14
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:18,559
In that case, we were measured
as using relative measure.

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,360
And, one interesting measure
called silhouette coefficient

16
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,600
can be used for relative measure, okay?

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,650
But, actually, silhouette coefficient
also popularly used as internal measure.

18
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:42,800
That means we will be able to use it to
check cluster cohesion and separation.

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,480
So, I first introduce it
as an internal measure

20
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,110
before I introduce it
as an external measure.

21
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,867
So for every point, x sub i,

22
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:59,630
we can calculate its silhouette
coefficient, s sub i, okay?

23
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,900
How we calculate it?

24
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,398
We use this formula this formula actually,
mu sub n,

25
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:11,830
is the mean distance to
the point of its own cluster.

26
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,490
Simply says, if we find this
point in the blue cluster, okay?

27
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,566
We're going to see this x sub i,
actually to all the points

28
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:27,540
in it's own cluster that
distance we want to reach them.

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,195
We get a mean distance that's mu sub n.

30
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:36,265
Then what is mu sub out's mean, okay?

31
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:41,455
That means we want to see this
blue point to its closest

32
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:46,365
cluster which is this orange one,
to its closest cluster.

33
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:51,439
All the points its closest cluster,
we calculate their mean distance,

34
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,620
that's this value, mu sub out mean, okay?

35
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,010
Then what we want to
see is their distance,

36
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,086
you probably can clearly see for
any point x sub i.

37
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:07,190
You want that the internal distance,
its rhythm is small but

38
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,910
even to its closest cluster,
this average reason be big.

39
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,160
So, to that extent, this value usually

40
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,830
should be positive and
the more positive the better, okay?

41
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,860
Then we, we normalize it, we divide by the
maximum value between this mu out mean.

42
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,000
And the mu n, and
if we pick up the two, so

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,520
it simply says that this division
must be smaller than one.

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,340
But on the other hand, if this cluster
to one, simply says, it's better because

45
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,510
the internal is very compact to
the outside is the reasonably big.

46
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,507
This is only for one point,
what is for the whole clustering?

47
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:49,510
Okay, so silhouette coefficient for

48
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,150
the whole clustering is you
take all the end points.

49
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,866
You calculate every one's
silhouette coefficient s sub i.

50
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:02,500
I from 1 to n you calculate all
the s sub i, you normalize it,

51
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,710
you divide it by the number of points n.

52
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,570
You get the whole clusterings
silhouette coefficient.

53
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,340
Of course, these silhouette coefficient,
if it's closer to plus 1, it,

54
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,000
it implies good clustering.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,050
Because the internal one to its own points
is rather close to the other cluster,

56
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,240
even to the closest one, is really far.

57
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,490
So we also can use this silhouette
coefficient as a relative measure.

58
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,570
For example, we can use it to estimate
the number of clusters in the data, say,

59
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,520
what is the best of k.

60
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,990
We can pick a value that yield the best
at clustering, that means yielding

61
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:52,690
the high value for SC and SC sub i, okay?

62
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,490
For example, you can, thinking about,
you did a lot of clustering, okay?

63
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,040
For all the i's, you want to see which
one give you the best clustering?

64
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,120
That means which one gives you
the highest silhouette coefficient?

65
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,320
Then you can pick up that instantiation,
pick that k.

66
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,897
So that's the usage of silhouette
coefficient as a relative measure.

67
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:27,897
