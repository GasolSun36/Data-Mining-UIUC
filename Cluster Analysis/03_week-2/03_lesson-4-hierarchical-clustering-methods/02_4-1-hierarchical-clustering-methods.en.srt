[SOUND] In the first
section we will introduce,

2
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:13,758
Basic Concepts of Hierarchical Algorithms.

3
00:00:13,758 --> 00:00:16,637
So what is hierarchical clustering?

4
00:00:16,637 --> 00:00:24,398
The hierarchical clustering means we can
start from either singleton cluster,

5
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:30,229
iteratively merge them into
higher level clusters, okay.

6
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:33,659
Or we can start from
one big macro cluster,

7
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,290
iteratively split the bigger
cluster into smaller ones.

8
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,410
Then in this way we will
generate a clustering hierarchy,

9
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,670
drawn as a dendrogram like this.

10
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,407
There is no requirement to specify K,
the number of clusters.

11
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:52,868
And it is more deterministic.

12
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:57,411
There is no iterative refinement process.

13
00:00:57,411 --> 00:01:02,771
Hierarchical clustering methods
contain two categories of algorithms.

14
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:07,272
In general, the hierarchical
clustering methods have two

15
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:12,120
categories of algorithms,
one called agglomerative.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,970
It start with singleton clusters,
continuously merge two

17
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,970
clusters at a time to build
bottom-up hierarchy of clusters.

18
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,370
The second category is
called divisive cluster.

19
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,960
Essentially, it starts
with a huge macro-cluster,

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,600
then split them continuous
into two groups.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,679
It will generate a top-down
hierarchy of clusters.

22
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:48,679
