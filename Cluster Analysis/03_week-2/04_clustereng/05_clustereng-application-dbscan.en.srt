Hi, my name is Sun lee Jong.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,810
I'm a kitchen assistant
of this Coursera course.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,800
Today, I'm going to introduce, how to
use an online cresting tool to apply and

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,750
to visualize the DBSCAN algorithm
from the real data set.

5
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:21,100
DBSCAN algorithm is introduced
in test the base algorithm.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,100
If you're not familiar with the technical
details you may want to review the slides.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,720
The data site that we're using today
is a Yelp restaurant data site.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,160
It contains locations of a hundred
restaurants in Waterloo, Canada.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,150
Each location is represented
by its longitude and latitude.

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,510
And we find this data
set in course material.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,806
To start with,
we upload a data set file to the website,

12
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:52,009
select the given data set file and
then click on Start button.

13
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,040
The website is going to have
it automatically uploaded.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,640
Then, make sure we're clustering by rows,
instead of clustering by columns.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,800
Because each row here actually
represents a location.

16
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,000
Now, we choose a classroom
method to the DBSCAN and

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,320
insert the parameter value for epsilon.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,530
Epsilon is the parameter in DBSCAN
algorithm, defines the neighborhood.

19
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,534
Here, we choose epsilon to be 0.005.

20
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:24,778
Click on Submit.

21
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:32,250
Here is a visualization of
the clustering results.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,268
Because we are running the algorithm
on a two dimensional dataset.

23
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:39,780
We only need to look at this
very first visualization figure.

24
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,440
Each card represents a certain cluster.

25
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,460
And one of our cluster actually
represents the others.

26
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,920
As you can see from this visualization,
one of the most important characteristics

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,680
of the DBSCAN algorithm, is that they can
generate clusters of arbitrary shape,

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,246
in self clusters of just.

29
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:06,260
So I want to try different
parameter settings

30
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,220
to see how the classroom
result is different.

31
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,360
And I also want to try the classroom
algorithms different view of datasets.

32
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,512
If you're interested about exploring
more about DBSCAN algorithms,

33
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:24,756
here are some interesting open
questions about the algorithm.

34
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:26,417
Thank you.
