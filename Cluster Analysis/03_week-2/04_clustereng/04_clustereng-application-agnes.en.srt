Hi.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,110
I am Hong Lay Drong.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,230
I am teaching assistant
of this Coursera course.

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,190
Today, I'm going to introduce how to
use an online clustering tool to apply

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,040
an agglomerative hierarchical
clustering algorithm on real data sets.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,950
The technical details of the hierarchical
clustering algorithms already

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,950
introduced in previous slides.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,780
If you're not familiar with
the technical details,

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,000
you may want to review
the previous lessons.

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,962
There are several different ways
to implement the hierarchical

11
00:00:33,962 --> 00:00:35,620
clustering algorithm.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,197
The major difference is on how
do you define the dissimilarity.

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,097
And to clarify in this system,

14
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:47,870
we use average link
definition of dissimilarity.

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,000
In this example, we're going to use
the data set of gene expression.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,350
You can find the list of such data
sets in the link given in this slide.

17
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:04,900
In this data set, each row represents a
gene, and each column represents a sample.

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,323
The value in this data set
represents the measured gene

19
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:14,820
expression of a certain gene
within the surgeon sample.

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,496
To start with, we select the surgeon
gene expression data set and

21
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,800
insert the name of the data set.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,400
Here, we use an example of GDS10 data set.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,004
Click on submit.

24
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:34,780
Here is how a hierarchical
clustering result looks like.

25
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,740
This part visualized
the clustering results of genes

26
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,030
represented by a dendrogram.

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,370
If you want to get a clustering results
with a certain clustered number,

28
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,570
let's say, if you want to get
a clustering results with four clusters,

29
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:55,250
we can cut at a certain point of
the dendrogram and get clustering results.

30
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,500
Similarly, here's a dendrogram of samples.

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,810
And a heat map visualize
a clustering data set.

32
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,640
And a larger value is
represented by green color and

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,110
smaller value is represented by red color.

34
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,940
On the website, you can actually
interact with the clustering results.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,428
As you can see,
if I want to determine a certain branch,

36
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:28,257
the dendrogram, we can select
a certain branch, click and hold,

37
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:34,360
To determine and see more details
on the clustering results.

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,471
I'm going to zoom out, you can simply
click on this unzoom rows button,

39
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:47,960
To get to the original results.

40
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,240
If you want to perform hierarchical
clustering on your own data set,

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,730
you can also do so on the website.

42
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,920
Upload the data set here.

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,522
This is the data set of restaurant
locations in Waterloo, Canada.

44
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,678
Choose hierarchical clustering as
a clustering method and as I said,

45
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:12,330
the number of clusters here.

46
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,170
Click on submit.

47
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,010
The visualization of the clustering
results is going to be shown here.

48
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,499
Of course, you can also try
different parameter settings or

49
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:30,174
try these algorithms on different real
data sets to see how the results differ.

50
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:36,823
If you're interested in exploring more
on hierarchical clustering algorithm,

51
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:38,690
here are some open questions.

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,701
Thank you, and enjoy.
