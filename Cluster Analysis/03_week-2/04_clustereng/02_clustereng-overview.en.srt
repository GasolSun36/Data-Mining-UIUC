00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,370
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,810
This is.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,710
I'm a teaching assistant for
the Classroom Management course.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,530
Today, I'm glad to give you a brief
introduction to ClusterEnG,

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,760
which is a tool that allows
you to play with different

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,250
classroom algorithms you have
learned from the course.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,440
First of all, what is ClusterEnG?

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,350
ClusterEnG are to developed by
the Computational Biology Group at UIUC.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,160
It allows the users to perform ClusterEnG
analysis in an interactive way.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,960
On ClusterEnG,
you can create your own data,

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,020
choose different ClusterEnG algorithms,
and the results.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,270
We recommend you to play with it,
because it can help you understand

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,390
how different the ClusterEnG
algorithms work in practice.

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,466
To use ClusterEnG you will first need to
visit a website which is provided here.

15
00:00:54,991 --> 00:01:00,230
After opening ClusterEnG, you will see
that it includes three major steps.

16
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,940
The first step is data preparation.

17
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,440
And second step is choosing
the Algorithms, and

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,910
the parameters that you want to use.

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,640
And final step is the visualization
of the cluster results.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,650
In the rest of this tutorial,

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,379
we'll introduce the details
of those three steps.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,400
In the data preparation step,

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,830
you need to prepare the data that you
want to perform classroom analysis on.

24
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,340
There are two choices.

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,710
The first one is to upload
the own data file that you have.

26
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,190
The uploaded file could
either be in CSV format

27
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,980
where the elements
are separated by commas.

28
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,680
Or the TXT format where the elements
are separated by spaces which helps.

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,680
To give you a concrete example, here I
have created very simple CSV file that

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,290
includes 15 data points, and
each data point is two dimensional.

31
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,765
After choosing the created data file,

32
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:01,774
I just need to hit the start
button to upload it.

33
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:06,619
And after uploading, I choose rows here,

34
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,430
because all the little points are stored
as rows in the uploaded file.

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,000
Also, I choose no here,
because I don't have row names or

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,770
IDs in my first data file.

37
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,820
Another option for

38
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,799
preparing the data is to use the sample
data size provided by clustering.

39
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,780
Once you're done with preparing the data,
next

40
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,290
step is choose the clustering algorithm
and the parameters that you want to use.

41
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,430
As you can see from the website,
clustering actually covers a quite

42
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,079
wide range of different clustering
algorithms including k-means, k-medoids,

43
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,651
hierarchical clustering.

44
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,720
DBSCAN and several others.

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,270
If you are not sure which clustering
algorithm you should use, there's

46
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,640
actually a tutorial page on the website
that compares the different pros and

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,620
cons of different clustering algorithms.

48
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,110
You can read through them and choose the
appropriate algorithm based on your needs.

49
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,850
For our simulator, lets just use k
means as our class algorithm and

50
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,950
that sets the number of
class rows to three.

51
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,970
Then we hit submit to round k
means on the uploaded file.

52
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,399
The final step is to initialize and
interpret the classroom results.

53
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,740
Since classroom is designed to
support both low dimensional and

54
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,930
high dimensional data class range,
we visualize the results

55
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,730
using PCA which is a very well known
dimension reduction technique.

56
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,680
There are two different models, the first
one is two-dimensional models Which

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,760
provides the clustering plots on two
of the first rate principal components.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,120
And the second mode is
the three-dimensional mode

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,189
which plots the visualization results
on the first grid principal components.

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Since the data file we just used is
two-dimensional, we only need to look at

61
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,767
the first plot under
the two-dimensional viewing mode.

62
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:14,100
We can see the 15 data points are
separated into three different clusters

63
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,940
by the k-means algorithm, where
the different clusters are represented

64
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,680
using different colors We're now
introducing the basic usage of ClusterEnG.

65
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,450
If you want to know more about this tool
you can find more resources on their

66
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,700
website.

67
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,726
Also in the following weeks we'll go
into the detail of several different

68
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:38,860
clustering algorithms by [INAUDIBLE].

69
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,580
