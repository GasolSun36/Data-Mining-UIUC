00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:11,680
We first discussed basic concepts
of density-based clustering.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,470
What is density-based clustering?

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,530
Essentially, we do
clustering-based on density.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,190
Which is a local clustering criterion,

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,760
that means just to look at surroundings
to see how dense this reading could be.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,810
We may introduce density-connected points.

8
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:37,800
Its major features are we
can discover clusters

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,427
of arbitrary shape rather than just
compact or something like a sphere.

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,500
It can handle noise nicely.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,300
You may just use one scan because

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,550
it only examines the local
region to justify its density.

13
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,380
But it needs density parameters
as a termination condition.

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,350
There are several interesting studies.

15
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,160
For example, DBSCAN,
we are going to cover in this lecture.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,680
Optics, we are going to
cover also in this lecture.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,790
Denclue, we may not have time to cover it,
but it's in the textbook.

18
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,960
CLIQUE, developed by
Rakesh Agrawal's group,

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,072
we will cover it in
the grid-based lecture.
