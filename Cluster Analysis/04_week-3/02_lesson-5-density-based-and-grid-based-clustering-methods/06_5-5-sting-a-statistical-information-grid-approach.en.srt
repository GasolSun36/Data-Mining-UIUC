2
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,860
We first introduced STING,
the first grid based method which

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,650
is statistic information
in the grid structure.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,010
This method called statistic
information grid approach.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,530
Essentially you can think the gray
structure looks like this.

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,880
You got multiple layers.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,570
That means the spacial area's
defined into rectangular cells

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,809
at the different levels of revolution.

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,970
Then these cells actually
form a tree structure.

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,910
That means each cell at a higher layer,

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,200
each cell actually store a summary
of the lower level set of cells.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,110
That means the cell at a higher level
contains a number of small cells

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,870
of the next lower level.

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,620
To that extent,
it forms a hierarchical tree structure.

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,920
What the cell will store, statistical
information of each cell that is

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,530
calculated and stored beforehand and
then can be used to answer queries.

17
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,010
That means you can calculate
the statistical information

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,080
that is corresponding set of
cells at the lower layer.

19
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:28,950
Then the parameter of the higher level
cells, the calculation contains a bunch of

20
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,419
statistical information including number
of points in the cell which is a count.

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,830
Then their mean, their standard deviation,

22
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,190
the minimum value, the maximum value and
also the type of distribution.

23
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,610
For example whether these points
form a normal distribution,

24
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,399
a uniform distribution or
other kinds of distributions.

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,630
So if we store the cell
in a hierarchical way,

26
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,050
to process a region query
including finding clusters,

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,220
we can start at the root
of this grid structure.

28
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,919
And proceed to the next lower level
using this STING indexing structure.

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,820
That means we can calculate the likelihood
a cell is relevant to the query at some

30
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,110
confidence level using the statistical
information stored in the cell.

31
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,870
Once we are confident, we need to go down,

32
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,310
only children of the likely relevant
cells are recursively explored.

33
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,580
So it is quite localized,
it could be quite efficient.

34
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,840
We can repeat this process until
the bottom layer is reached.

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,740
The advantage is this structure
is query-independent.

36
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:56,070
And the process can be easily paralyzed
and we can do incremental update as well.

37
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,370
Also the efficiency is very good.

38
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,940
That means the complexity
is quite low because

39
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,200
if the K is number of grid
cells at the lowest level.

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,040
Then the complexity is big O linear to K,

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,670
where K is much less than N,
the number of data points.

42
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,890
However, it's disadvantages,
because you formed a grid structure,

43
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,070
you may lose a lot of details.

44
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,345
The probabilistic nature
of the higher level may

45
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:39,429
imply a loss of accuracy in the lower
level for query processing.

46
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:49,429
