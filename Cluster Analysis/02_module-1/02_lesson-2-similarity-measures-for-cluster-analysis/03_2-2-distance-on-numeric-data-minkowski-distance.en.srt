1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,549
[SOUND] Now we examine Session 2:

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:14,239
Distance on
Numerical Data: Minkowski Distance.

3
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:19,590
So we first introduced data matrix and
dissimilarity matrix, or distance matrix.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,660
Data matrix is referenced in the typical
matrix form is we have n data points,

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,490
we use n rows.

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,280
We have l dimensions, we use l
columns to reference this data set.

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,940
The distance matrix or
dissimilar matrix usually is referenced in

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,205
triangular matrix because
you have n data points,

9
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:49,070
we register only the distance
between like objects

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,890
one versus one or
two versus one to look at their distance.

11
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,630
But the distance function usually
could be quite different, but

12
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,621
different kinds of variables, like a real,

13
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:07,201
boolean, categorical, ordinal,
ratio, and vector variables.

14
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,522
Their distance definition
could be different.

15
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:15,100
Moreover, sometimes they may have
weights associated with those

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,180
different variables based on
the applications and data semantics.

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,290
We are going to introduce this more later.

18
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,710
Then, we look at an example.

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,900
Suppose we have four points,
four objects in two dimensional space.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,900
Then the data matrix is rampant
in this typical form, okay.

21
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:43,580
Then for dissimilarity matrix, or
distance matrix, for Euclidean distance,

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,760
you can see the matrix is in this way,
like x1, x1, they are identical.

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,610
Their distance is 0.

24
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,290
x2, x1, their computation
is based on the distance.

25
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:01,190
This part is two, this distance is three,
you take the sum of the square area.

26
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,070
You take square root, you get this value.

27
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,610
Then in general, we define
the Minkowski distance of this formula.

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,020
It means if we have area dimensions for
object i and object j.

29
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,140
Then their distance is defined by
taking every dimension to look

30
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,520
at their absolute value of their distance,
then to the power of p,

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,710
then you sum them up, get the root of p.

32
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,600
Then we get the Minkowski distance.

33
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,030
Such distance that P is the order
we usually also call this

34
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,710
distance this LP norm.

35
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,880
The Minkowski distance in
general have these properties.

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,676
The first property is called positivity.

37
00:02:55,676 --> 00:03:00,200
It means, the distance be equal zero when

38
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,130
they are identical otherwise
they are greater in there.

39
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,650
The second property called symmetry means

40
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,670
the distance between I and J, distance
between J and I should be identical.

41
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,490
Then the third one called
triangular inequality means for

42
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,580
the distance between i and j.

43
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,990
If you go through k, that means you
go first to k, then from k to j.

44
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:38,089
That distance should be no less
than directly go from i to j.

45
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:45,519
Should be greater than or equal to d(i,j).

46
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,780
The distance measure that satisfies these
three properties are metric distance.

47
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:59,050
Notice not all the distance are metric for
example set difference is not metric.

48
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,180
Of course in this lecture we
mainly discuss metric distance.

49
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,408
Then we look at some special
cases of Minkowski distance.

50
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:13,980
If p = 1, we call L1 norm,
they also call Manhattan or

51
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,700
city block distance define this formula.

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,437
In particular, if we are dealing
with binary vectors we call these

53
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:26,660
Hamming distance is the number
of bits that are different.

54
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,990
Then if p equals two,
you can find also L2 norm.

55
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,250
As Euclidean distance defined
the typical way like this, and

56
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:46,740
this vary for the middle one I think for
all people, okay?

57
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,830
Then if p goes to infinity means
we're dealing with L infinity norm or

58
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,654
L max norm,
this is also caused supernum distance.

59
00:04:57,654 --> 00:05:03,270
Is that you find, is limit for
p goes for infinity.

60
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,563
In that case, actually
the distance is really the maximum

61
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:13,923
difference between any
attribute of the vectors.

62
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:18,507
For example you can see for
F, from 1 to L.

63
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:23,050
The maximum such absolute
value of the distance,

64
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,880
is the distance of L infinity norm or
supremum distance.

65
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,210
Let's look at some examples, for
the same data sets, we get a four points.

66
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,540
We get two dimensions.

67
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Then we look at the Manhattan distance
is just a city block distance.

68
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:49,270
For example from x2 to x1 you

69
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,500
will go three blocks down
then two blocks left.

70
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,880
So the Manhattan distance is 3 plus 2,
we get 5, okay.

71
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,740
Of course x1 to x1 itself, is 0.

72
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:10,980
And you Euclidean distance, as we
discussed already, that's the measure.

73
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,582
For Supremum distance, L infinity norm.

74
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,857
You probably can see x2 to x1.

75
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:23,816
So probably you can see the difference
is you first go down 3 blocks for

76
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:28,370
Manhattan distance,
you can see you get a 3 plus 2.

77
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,178
But for Supremum distance you
could just see which attribute

78
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:37,702
would give the maximum distance or
maximum difference so

79
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:44,505
you probably can see the maximum amount is
3 instead of 2 that's why x2 to x1 is 3.

80
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:49,079
So it's pretty easy to compute, thank you.

81
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:59,079
