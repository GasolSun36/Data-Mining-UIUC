2
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:11,122
In this session, we are going
to discus proximity measure for

3
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:14,530
symmetric vs asymmetric binary variables.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,520
For binary variables,

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,830
we usually report their occurrences
using contingency tables.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,510
Okay, suppose we have two objects,
i and j.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:35,530
The number of times they both appear could
be q, they both missing could be t cases.

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,780
I appears and j does not,
there are r cases.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,560
And i does not appear,
and j appears s times,

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,880
then for symmetric binary variables
that means the chance they appear or

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,560
they not appear actually
have equivalent chances,

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,540
or approximately same chances w call
this as symmetric binary variables.

13
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,320
In our case they are distance,
like r and s.

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,180
These two cases, they are different, so

15
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,520
their distance measure is r+s
divided by all the cases.

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,850
For asymmetric binary variables,
usually we assume they both appear,

17
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:32,750
the case is much rarer than
they both not appearing, okay.

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,460
So for these asymmetric variables,
they are different as r + s, but

19
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,640
they both not appearing.

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,100
In that case,
actually is t is not so important.

21
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,010
The reason For example has only
the parts of y where attract attention.

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,311
Then for that distance measure it we

23
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:04,630
look at r + s divide by q + r + s.

24
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,440
That means all the cases
with t cases removed, okay.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,590
Then for their similarity measure, that
means, how many times they are the same?

26
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,310
Actually it's a q cases.

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,920
For the q cases, we probably can't
see that's a same denominator.

28
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,930
Actually, Jaccard coefficient
was somehow rediscovered in

29
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,910
the Pattern Discovery here,
they call this one coherence.

30
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,550
And here, this coherence definition,
if you really map them

31
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,470
into this contingence table, they have the
same definition as Jaccard coefficient.

32
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,470
So then we look at the real cases,
suppose we have some medical tests.

33
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,310
Then we have Jack, Mary, and
Jim, three cases, three people.

34
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,200
Their tests actually is
represented in this table.

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,280
We can map them into table,
since gender, the chance to be male or

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,130
female are roughly equivalent,
so this is a symmetric cases, so

37
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,130
for us we are only interested
in asymmetric cases,

38
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,100
that is the remaining attributes
becomes more important.

39
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,660
Then we try to examine
how they are different.

40
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,930
Suppose we say Y and P,
is positive case, and

41
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,610
the value N, no, are not the case,
will be 0, okay.

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,210
In our case, we look at our distance
special for asymmetric attributes,

43
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,970
we can work out these [INAUDIBLE] for
example, if a Jack and Mary,

44
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,260
would proceed, Jack and Mary,
they are the same parts of the case,

45
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,890
like those have fever.both
the test one actually is positive.

46
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,910
There are two such cases.

47
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,180
They are both negative, like a cough.

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,930
Test two and test four, actually there
are three cases they are both negative.

49
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,880
But they do have one
case they are different.

50
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,060
Similarly, we can work the table for
Jack and Jim, Jim and Mary.

51
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,500
In this case we can
calculate their difference.

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,290
Probably we can easily see Jack and

53
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,840
Mary actually are most similar,
Jim and Mary are most different.

54
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,744
We may conclude that Jack and

55
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:45,172
Mary may have similar

56
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:50,096
a disease in this case.
