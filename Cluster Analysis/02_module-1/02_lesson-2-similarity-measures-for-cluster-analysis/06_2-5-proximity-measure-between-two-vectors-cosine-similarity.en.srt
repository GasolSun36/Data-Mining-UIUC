00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:09,743
In this session,
we're going to introduce cosine

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:14,501
similarity as approximate
measure between two vectors,

4
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:21,116
how we look at the cosine similarity
between two vectors, how they are defined.

5
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:25,655
So we can take a text document as example.

6
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:30,200
A text document can be
represented by a bag of words or

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,690
more precise a bag of terms.

8
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,624
Each document can be
represented as a long vector,

9
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:41,479
each attribute recording
the frequency of a particular term.

10
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,020
The term can be a word or
it can be a phrase.

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:53,552
5 means the term team, actually occurring
in Document 1, five times, okay.

12
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:59,056
So, we want to compare the similarity
between Document 1 and Document 2.

13
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:01,169
So how similar they are?

14
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:03,874
We could use cosine similarity to do that.

15
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:08,367
Other vector objects like gene
features in micro-arrays can be

16
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:12,371
represented in the similar
way as a long vector, 'kay.

17
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:16,025
For information retrieval,
biological taxonomy,

18
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:19,843
gene feature mapping,
like a micro-array analysis,

19
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:24,890
these are good applications to compare
similarity between two vectors.

20
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,280
The cosine measure is defined as follows.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,225
For example,

22
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:34,990
we can consider the term-frequency
vector to look at their similarity.

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,247
They are defined by dot
product of these two

24
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:44,222
vectors divided by
the product of their lengths.

25
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:50,840
So we look at the, the cosine similarity
definition, and take as an example.

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,946
Suppose d sub 1 and
d sub 2 are the vectors of

27
00:01:55,946 --> 00:02:01,880
these two documents, okay,
then we can calculate

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,406
their vectors dot product as follows,
'kay.

29
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:12,239
Then we can calculate the length
of each one of d sub 1's lengths,

30
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,508
calculate using this formula, okay.

31
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:17,847
D sub 2's two lengths eh,

32
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:23,764
can be calculated also using the square
root of sum of their product.

33
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:29,719
Then the cosine similarity can be
calculated using the formula given above.

34
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:34,762
We can see their cosine
similarity is 0.94,

35
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:40,180
simply says these two
documents are quite similar.

36
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:50,180
