2
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:11,360
Basic concepts means how to measure
similarity between objects.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,520
Since clustering is
an unsupervised learning process,

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,550
so we do not have predefined levels
to judge whether it's right or wrong.

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,720
So how can we judge
a clustering process is good?

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,909
That means whether it will
produce high-quality clusters.

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,080
Usually, we keep two measures,
one called high intra-class similarity,

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,110
the other called low
inter-class similarity.

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,860
What is high intra-class similarity?

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,430
That means you want to see
the objects within the same cluster,

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,730
they are rather similar,
they are cohesive.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,130
You also want to see
inter-class similarity

13
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,640
is low in the sense you want to see
the objects in different clusters.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,240
They are rather dissimilar,
or they are distinctive.

15
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,860
So to measure this,

16
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,370
we need some separate quality function
to measure how good a cluster it is.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,680
However, it is hard to define
what is similar enough or

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,030
good enough and the answer usually
could be quite subjective.

19
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,080
That's the reason we want to look
at different similarity measures or

20
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,890
the similarity functions for different
applications, but they are critical for

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,750
cluster analysis.

22
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,378
For terminologies, people actually
want to distinguish a quite

23
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:47,681
interesting similar things
called similarity measure,

24
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:51,380
dissimilarity measure,
or proximity measure.

25
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,690
What is similarity measure or
similarity function?

26
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,430
Usually, similarity function
is a real value function

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,580
to quantify the similarity
between two objects.

28
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,340
Usually the higher value,
it means more similar.

29
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,250
So the value range is 0 to 1.

30
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,930
0 means there's no similarity.

31
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,840
1 means they are completely similar,
or they are identical.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,490
Then similar to similarity,
many people want to use dissimilarity,

33
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,740
or distance measure.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,960
Distance measure or distance function
is a new micro measure to measure how

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,170
different these two objects are.

36
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,140
To some extent, dissimilarities,
inverse of similarities,

37
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,630
that means the lower or
the shorter the distance, the more alike.

38
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,920
The minimum dissimilarity is 0, means
there are completely similar or identical.

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,190
The value range could be either 0 to 1 or
0 to infinity based on the definition.

40
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,821
Another term called proximity,

41
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:10,289
this is usually referred to either
similarity or dissimilarity.

42
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:20,289
