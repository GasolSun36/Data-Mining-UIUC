00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,704
[SOUND] Now we examine

2
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:12,760
distance between categorical attributes,
ordinal attributes, and mixed types.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,330
What are categorical attributes?

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,660
Categorical attributes,

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,280
also called nominal attributes because
their value references by names.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,990
Take color as a example, we may have
yellow, red, orange, blue, green.

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:37,160
If we get their positions in color
spectrum in physics, they are not ordered.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,017
In the sense either the two values
are the same or they are different.

9
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:45,130
The same as profession and
many other things.

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,990
Then how to calculate their distance.

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,648
We can use simple matching method.

12
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:58,954
For example, suppose there are total
p variables, and their m matches.

13
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:03,110
Then the number of mismatch is p minus m.

14
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,970
So their distance between i and

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,650
j will be the number of mismatches
versus the total number of variables.

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,160
Another measure is we can
mapthem into binary variables.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,660
That means each value like red if they

18
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,300
are existing as a red
we write down as one.

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,690
If they are not red,
we write down as zero.

20
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:36,810
Then we can change the categorical
attributes into a set of binary variables.

21
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,610
Then we can use the previous
binary attribute

22
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,460
evaluation function to evaluate them.

23
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,890
Another kind of variable
called ordinal variables.

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,400
Ordinal variable means they do have order.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,080
They can be discrete like a rank,
like a military rank,

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,790
or even the rank for undergraduate
students in the university, okay.

27
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,840
Or they could be continuous,
like time, okay?

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,960
Then order becomes important.

29
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,300
For example, in the University,

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,820
a freshman is a first year,
a senior is a fourth year student.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,170
In that sense, we can replace
ordinal variable value by its rank.

32
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,880
Then we can map any particular

33
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,380
variable using this formula map
onto this either 0 or 1, okay.

34
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,830
Just give you an example.

35
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:41,385
For example, we can map freshman into
0 because their position is 1- 1 0.

36
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:47,490
And the same for senior it is four so
by the total range is four.

37
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,060
That's why they map into one.

38
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,060
Then the distance for
example between freshman and

39
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,740
senior would be one minus zero,
their distance is one.

40
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,250
But between junior and

41
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,840
senior their distance is only
one third because with this one,

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,860
now we can compute the other dissimilarity
using the interval scale variables.

43
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,440
What about we get a dataset may
contain all attribute types,

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,010
nominal symmetric binary,
asymmetric binary, numerical or ordinal.

45
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,770
No one can use a weighted
formula to combine the facts.

46
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,760
Then, if they are numerical data,

47
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,910
we can use normalize the distance,
like [INAUDIBLE].

48
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:41,050
If they are binary, or nominal data, we
can use this formula as we just discussed.

49
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,964
If they are ordinal data we can compute
their distance using this formula.

50
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:50,965
Then we can combine all their effects
to compute their overall distance.

51
00:03:50,965 --> 00:04:00,965
