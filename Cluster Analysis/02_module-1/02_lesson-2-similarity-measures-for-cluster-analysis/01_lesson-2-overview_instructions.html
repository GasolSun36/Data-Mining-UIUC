  Lesson 2: Similarity Measures for Cluster Analysis
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this lesson, you will learn the general concepts of distance or similarity measures between objects.  We will: introduce the basic concepts of similarity measure; study the concepts and formulas for computing distances on numeric data, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and supremum distance, for computing proximity for symmetric vs. asymmetric binary variables, for computing distances between categorical attributes, ordinal attributes, and mixed types; and learn the concept and methods for computing proximity measure between two vectors, such as cosine similarity, and for computing correlation measures between two variables: covariance and correlation coefficient.

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this lesson, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
