  Lesson 1: Cluster Analysis: An Introduction
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this lesson, you will learn the general concepts of cluster analysis, understand what cluster analysis is, and understand why it is useful and important in many applications.  You will also learn the basic requirements, challenges and applications of cluster analysis, get a multi-dimensional picture (categorization) of cluster analysis, understand there is a spectrum of methodologies of clustering methods, and get to know that different kinds of data may need different methodologies for cluster analysis.  Further, you will see that users may have different insights on clusters to be generated, which may guide desired methods and results of cluster analysis.

  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>

  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
