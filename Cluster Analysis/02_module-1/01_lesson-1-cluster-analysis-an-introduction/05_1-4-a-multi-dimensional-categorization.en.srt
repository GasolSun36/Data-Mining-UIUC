00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:03,277
[SOUND] In this session,

2
00:00:03,277 --> 00:00:08,924
we're going to provide a multi-dimensional

3
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:13,710
categorization of cluster analysis.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,326
Cluster analysis can be
viewed in many different way.

5
00:00:20,326 --> 00:00:24,995
We will provide a multi-dimensional
categorization on all the different

6
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:25,667
methods.

7
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:30,339
The first categorization
is based on techniques,

8
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:36,104
based on different techniques
employed in cluster analysis.

9
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:40,608
We can consider these
are density-based methods or

10
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:45,828
they are distance-based methods or
grid-based methods or

11
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:50,139
probabilistic generative
model based methods.

12
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:54,953
Or we are essentially using
dimensionality reduction measures

13
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:59,588
to reduce the dimensions before
we do effective clustering or

14
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:03,777
we can directly perform high
dimensional clustering or

15
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:08,339
whether the measures are scalable for
large data analysis.

16
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:14,099
And the second categorization
is based on data type-centered.

17
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,247
So that means different kinds
of data types likely were used,

18
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:20,971
rather different clustering methods.

19
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:25,986
For example, how to cluster
numerical data, category data,

20
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:30,148
text data, multimedia data,
time-series data,

21
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:35,274
sequence data, stream data,
network data or uncertain data.

22
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:39,466
The third categorization is whether we can

23
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:44,131
provide additional insights for
clustering.

24
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:47,702
For example,
we can provide a visual insights or

25
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:52,320
we can incorporate some kind of
semi-slightly supervision or

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,262
we can use ensemble-based measures or
we can use validation-based measures.

27
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:04,519
All these, we're going to get into
more detail in the next sessions.

28
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,121
Thank you.
