[SOUND] Hi, in this session, we're going

2
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:10,885
to discuss applications
of cluster analysis.

3
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:15,470
Cluster analysis has lots of applications.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,818
For example, it has been properly
used as pre-processing step or

5
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:24,742
intermediate step for
other data mining tasks.

6
00:00:24,742 --> 00:00:29,325
For example, you can generate complex
summary of data for classification,

7
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:33,781
pattern discovery, hypothesis
generation and testing and many others.

8
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:39,698
And it also has been popularly used for
outlier detection,

9
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:48,119
because outliers can be considered those
points that are far away from any cluster.

10
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,565
Cluster analysis also has been used for
data summarization,

11
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:54,708
compression and reduction.

12
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:58,084
For example, in im, image processing,

13
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:03,492
vector quantization has been using
cluster analysis quite a lot.

14
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:08,830
Cluster analysis also can be used for
collaborative filtering,

15
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,198
recommendation systems or
customer segmentation,

16
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:19,615
because clusters can be used to find
like-minded users or similar products.

17
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:26,215
Cluster analysis also has been used for
trend detection, for dynamic data.

18
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:29,779
For example, we can cluster stream data or

19
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:34,531
detecting trends and
patterns in dynamic data strings.

20
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:40,566
And cluster analysis also has been
used for multimedia data analysis,

21
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:45,405
biological data analysis and
social network analysis.

22
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:52,367
For example, we can use cluster
clustering methods to cluster images or

23
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:58,045
videos or audio clips or
we can use cluster analysis on genes and

24
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:02,998
protein sequences and
many other interesting tasks.

25
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:03,498
Thank you.
