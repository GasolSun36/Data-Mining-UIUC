Hi, in this session,

2
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:13,160
I'm going to give you a brief overview
of user insights and clustering.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,630
Usually, users may have some
interesting insights or views.

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,790
User may like to interact
with the clustering process,

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,420
to influence the final
results of clustering.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,100
One interesting one is visual insights,

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,500
because a picture is
worth a thousand words.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,630
Human eyes are actually powerful,
high-speed processors.

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:44,440
Because they are also linked
with rich knowledge base.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,580
So, a human can provide
a lot of intuitive insights

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,830
whether this clustering result is good or

12
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,950
something they desired is not achieved
based on the current clustering result.

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:04,796
Okay, there's usually user's
good to one or two dimensional,

14
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:09,782
at most 3D,
they may be able to find clusters.

15
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:13,554
Their algorithms, for
example, High D eyes,

16
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:17,246
how to visualize high
dimensional clusters.

17
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:24,081
The second one is
semi-supervised insights,

18
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:31,530
that means user may have certain insights
or intention on the clustering process.

19
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,410
They may like to pass their
insights to the system to

20
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,710
influence the results of the clustering.

21
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,900
For example,
user may provide some seeding.

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,240
That means you can provide
a number of labeled examples or

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,090
some approximate representation
of the categories of interest.

24
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,600
Then you may like
the clustering process to

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,180
take your insight to do
some desired clustering.

26
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,414
The third one is multi-view and
ensemble-based insights.

27
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:07,460
So-called multi-view clustering
is different clustering

28
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,906
may generate different perspectives.

29
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:14,050
The multiple clustering,

30
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,010
you can ensemble them together
to provide more robust solution.

31
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,780
Finally, a very important one
is validation-based insight.

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,520
That means,
you may want to evaluate the quality

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,290
of the clusters generated based
on certain validation methods.

34
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:37,080
For example, you may use case studies or
you may provide specific measures,

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,122
or you may provide some
preexisting labels.

36
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:45,990
All of these, we're going to
discuss in detail in some chapter.

37
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,680
Finally, I provide a few reference books.

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,430
And especially the chapter
By Charu Aggarwal.

39
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,500
An Introduction to
Clustering Analysis is a very

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,040
nice introduction on general
ideas of clustering analysis.

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,788
Thank you.

42
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:14,788
