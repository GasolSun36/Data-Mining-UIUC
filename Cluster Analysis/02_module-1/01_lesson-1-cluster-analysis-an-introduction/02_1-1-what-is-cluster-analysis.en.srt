00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:11,080
The first session is on
what is Cluster Analysis?

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,740
To understand what is cluster analysis,
we should know first what is a cluster?

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,720
A cluster is actually
a collection of data objects,

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,690
those objects are similar
within the same cluster.

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,770
That means the objects are similar to
one another within the same group.

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,420
And they are rather different,
or they are dissimilar, or

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,230
unrelated, to the objects in other
groups or in other clusters.

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,560
Okay, then cluster analysis which
is also called clustering or

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:51,150
data segmentation, the essential is
getting a set of tape data points.

10
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:57,579
The cluster analysis is to partition them
into a set of clusters, or set of groups.

11
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,390
They are as similar as possible
within the same group and

12
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,020
as far apart as possible
among different groups.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,090
Cluster analysis is unsupervised learning,

14
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,280
in the sense there's
no predefined classes.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,484
This is very different from classification
which needs supervised learning or

16
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:25,430
needs to give in the class labors then you
can construct the classification models.

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,170
There are many ways to use
our apply cluster analysis,

18
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,100
essentially cluster analysis can
either provide as a stand alone

19
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,620
tool to get insight into your
data distribution like a summary.

20
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:48,135
Or you can serve, you can use it
to serve as pre-processing step or

21
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:51,932
intermediate step for other algorithms,

22
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:57,627
like a classification or
a prediction or like many other tasks,

23
00:01:57,627 --> 00:02:01,970
including data mining and
other applications.

24
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,222
Thank you.
