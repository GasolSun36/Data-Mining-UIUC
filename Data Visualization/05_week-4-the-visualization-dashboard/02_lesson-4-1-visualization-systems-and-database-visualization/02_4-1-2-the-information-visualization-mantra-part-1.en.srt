1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,951
[SOUND] So, in order to do good,
effective information visualization,

2
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:10,129
there's a nice information
visualization mantra

3
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:13,834
that's been set up to
remind us of the steps.

4
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:18,430
And we'll walk through that mantra and
each of the steps in the next three parts.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,227
So, when visualizing large
amounts of abstract information,

6
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:30,071
Ben Schneiderman has some really good
advice on how to do that effectively,

7
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,509
that he's formulated into a mantra.

8
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,405
And this mantra goes like this,
you overview first,

9
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:41,349
then you zoom and filter, and
then provide details only on demand.

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,780
And so overview first.

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,180
You provide a big picture of the data.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,640
You plot all of the data, but
don't show any details about the data,

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,070
giving you some big picture, be able
to understand the data set as a whole.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,140
And then once you can see the whole data
set, you can start to be curious and

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,280
focus on a particular area of the data and
so we zoom and

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,760
filter, in order to focus on a particular
portion of the data, subset of the data.

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,500
And then, once we've found
an appropriate subset to look at,

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,640
we can provide details only on demand.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,570
So, details are the individual
details of a single data item.

20
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,820
But only when they're requested, otherwise

21
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,540
plotting that many details about many
items can easily be visually overwhelming.

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,325
And so this mantra has been shown to
work really well on a lot examples

23
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:37,883
of large amounts of abstract information.

24
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:43,175
So here's a example of Ben Shneiderman's

25
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:48,110
mantra being used on the World Bank
indicators, to display,

26
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,360
for example, life expectancy and
population for every country in the world.

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,715
We start with an overview.

28
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,660
We've got a plot of every country in
the world plotted over population and

29
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,510
life expectancy.

30
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,000
I've zoomed in on the appropriate
areas and ranges of the data,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,260
so the population goes from
a minimum to a maximum.

32
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,061
The life expectancy goes from
its minimum and maximum, and

33
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:17,374
we can zoom in further as we need to.

34
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:20,890
I filtered out data, for example,
you can filter based on continent and

35
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,360
I've used that filter to then color
the data based on continent, and

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,330
that reveals other information for
example, Africa in general has some low

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:39,080
life expectancies and Asia, in green,
has some high-population countries.

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,610
And then you've got details on demand,
for example,

39
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,640
here is one country in Asia that has low
life expectancy, and that's Afghanistan.

40
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,830
And so, by proving those details
on demand, they don't obscure,

41
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,650
overwhelm you visually.

42
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,590
They're the result of interactivity
just as a result of a query, and so

43
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,280
this is a good example of how you
can use Ben Sheniderman's mantra for

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,440
the visualizing abstract
information from large data sets.

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,980
So the mantra begins with an overview,
to provide an overview of the data first,

46
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,020
and so this overview's often
a scatterplot of the entire dataset.

47
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,280
In this case, I've shown an example.

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,260
It's a scatterplot of all the countries
of the world, which is a large

49
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,890
amount of information, and I've plotted
it by population and life expectancy.

50
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,990
And so this is every single country.

51
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,710
I've omitted the labels of each country,

52
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,130
the name of each country,
because that would be a bit overwhelming.

53
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,880
So, we just have a data point for
each country.

54
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,860
And by using these axes we get
a high-level view of all the countries.

55
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,820
We can kind of get our
head around this data set.

56
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,580
And we can already start to
see some interesting issues

57
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,300
that we could be curious about.

58
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,540
For example, some of the countries
have low life expectancy.

59
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,640
There doesn't seem to be a correlation
between population and life expectancy.

60
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,560
And the challenge for this broad overview,
this ability to spread out your data and

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,310
to see all of it at once,
is to be able to find axes that do that.

62
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,680
So in this case,
I wanted to look at life expectancy, but

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,710
then I've chosen population.

64
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,630
And this choice of populations is
a bit of an arbitrary choice, but

65
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,670
it's one that spreads out the data well.

66
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,150
So for life expectancy, you'll notice
that we don't go from 0 to 85.

67
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,050
We go from 40 to 85 because we've
chosen tight minimum-maximum

68
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,250
bounds to better spread out
the data in this overview.

69
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,755
And for population, I haven't chosen
a linear scale for population,

70
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:50,862
I've chosen a logarithmic scale for
population that basically displays orders

71
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:55,911
of magnitude, starting from a billion
going down to 100,000 and less.

72
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:58,325
And so, this is a logarithmic scale,

73
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:01,800
because that better spreads
out the data in this case.

74
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,790
So, here's an example of
plotting an overview of your data

75
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,400
that allows you to see all of
your data in one big picture.

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,710
This is Tableau, and we're looking
at the World Bank indicators,

77
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,720
and we want to look at, for
example, Life Expectancy.

78
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,510
So if I drag life expectancy
over here as a field,

79
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,946
I get an average life
expectancy over all countries.

80
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:30,920
Now, if I want to see what
the life expectancy is by country,

81
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,120
I can just drag the country region
into the columns, and now I get

82
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,170
a individual life expectancy average over
the years that were measured, by country.

83
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,970
But this is quite a lot of countries,
and so you don't get a big picture.

84
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,490
This is observable but not displayable.

85
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,390
I can observe all of the data, but I can't
display all the data in a single picture

86
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,550
and still see all of the countries.

87
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,980
So we'd like to provide
a broad overview of

88
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,040
the life expectancy data
over all of the countries.

89
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,010
And in this case, we don't need to see
every country's name, so instead of

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,460
doing that, we can just drag the country
region over here into the marks.

91
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,540
And now I've got an individual mark for

92
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,570
every country projected onto a single
line, which doesn't spread the data out.

93
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,060
So, we need a way of spreading it out.

94
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,070
So we can pick, for example,

95
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,469
population, as a way of spreading
out the data horizontally.

96
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:38,250
And so now, I've plotted the data
by life expectancy vertically,

97
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,420
and by population horizontally.

98
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,590
And there are a few countries,
for example India and China,

99
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,990
that have around a billion people each,
over a billion people each, and

100
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,010
that's skewing the scale of
the rest of these countries.

101
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,060
So in order to spread this data out,
we don't want to use a linear scale,

102
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,540
we want to use a logarithmic scale.

103
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:07,140
So, I can edit this axis and
choose a logarithmic axis.

104
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,300
And now when I plot logarithmically,
the data gets spread out more evenly

105
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,728
across population because I'm displaying
population by order of magnitude,

106
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,140
factors of ten, instead of linearly.

107
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,332
But now the data is clumped up
in this upper-right quadrant,

108
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:31,333
so in order to see the data more clearly,

109
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:35,510
I'll want to spread this out
across the entire display.

110
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:41,457
So life expectancy,
instead of going from 0 years to 85 years,

111
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:47,098
I'll want to change that to about
40 years, so I can set the.

112
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,690
Minimum life expectancy to some
lower bound value of say, 40 years.

113
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,850
And now I can use my display resolution
to display more of the items and

114
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,100
to separate more of the items by that,
by setting tighter bounds.

115
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:11,470
And again by population,
if I set the population,

116
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,580
it looks like it goes from
about 10,000 up to 1 billion.

117
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:27,200
So, we'll set the lower end of
population to 10,000, instead of zero.

118
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,383
And now that spreads out the data,
and I've got this nice

119
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:36,366
overview of every single country
in my data set that's spread out.

120
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:40,028
It's plotting life expectancy,
and it's using population,

121
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:44,230
actually the logarithm of population
has a way of spreading the data out so

122
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,067
I can get a nice, big overview picture of
the data, so I can further investigate it.

123
00:08:52,852 --> 00:09:00,259
