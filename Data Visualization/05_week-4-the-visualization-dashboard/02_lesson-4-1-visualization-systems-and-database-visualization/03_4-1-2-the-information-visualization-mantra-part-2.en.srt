1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:08,345
[SOUND] So the next step of
the mantra is Zoom and Filter.

2
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:10,167
So let's look at zooming.

3
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:11,430
What does zooming do?

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,662
Zooming helps us focus on
a portion of the plotted data.

5
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:21,100
It removes extraneous data that's
outside of our zoomed in area.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:27,280
So here's an example of a plot of
data across the United States.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,570
And in this case, we've zoomed in on
a portion of the West to the Midwest.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,410
And then we've zoomed in again on
a portion of Northern California.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,650
And by zooming in at each of these levels,

10
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,550
we're removing a large
portion of our dataset.

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,830
So we can focus on a smaller
portion of our dataset.

12
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:53,293
And by expanding that smaller portion
of our dataset to the entire screen,

13
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:59,207
it allows us to use the resolution of the
entire display to display more details.

14
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:03,143
So at the highest level, we're just
showing the state boundaries, but

15
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:06,236
as we zoom in,
we can start to show county boundaries.

16
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:10,630
And then at the finer level,
we have enough room to where we can

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,389
add the names of counties, and
other data about each of the counties.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,858
And so by focusing on
a small portion of our data,

19
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:21,271
we can ignore large amounts of data.

20
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:25,905
And we can add more detail about
the data we're specifically looking at,

21
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:28,240
and so there's two ways of zooming.

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,690
There's this way where we're
looking at a portion of

23
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,350
the displayed coordinates of our datset
by, for example, clicking a window.

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,880
Or we can also expand axis fields.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,313
So for example,
if you're plotting data over time,

26
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:48,790
you might be looking at it by year.

27
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,784
If you want to focus on the year 2014
then you could click on 2014, and

28
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:55,667
expand that into quarters.

29
00:01:55,667 --> 00:02:00,056
And we could look at, say, the first three
quarters of 2014, and ignore 2013 and

30
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:00,650
2015.

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,480
So we can use our resolution to
more clearly see what's happening

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,800
at each quarter.

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,276
And then, we may be interested in Q2,
and you could expand that.

34
00:02:10,276 --> 00:02:15,224
And look at the individual months,
April, May and June of Q2, and ignore,

35
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:17,840
for example, the months in Q1 and Q3.

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,280
So in each of these cases, zooming
allows us to take the displayed data,

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,470
and to expand it to be able to focus
on a portion of the displayed data.

38
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,200
And ignore the rest of our dataset that's
not in that subset of our displayed data.

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,837
So here we've used Tableau to plot our
life expectancy data versus population for

40
00:02:39,837 --> 00:02:43,930
every country in the world, and
some of the data clumps up.

41
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,814
We have a big collection here of a bunch
of countries that have similar populations

42
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:50,240
and life expectancy.

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,760
And there's not enough resolution
to be able to know which

44
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,560
one we're pointing at if
we're looking at that.

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,721
So if I want to find out in these
clumpy areas what's going on,

46
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:05,290
I would zoom, and so
it would show the Zoom Controls.

47
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,880
Go over here and zoom in on this data,
and that will spread things out.

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,974
And I can see, for example,
this clump was Norway, Singapore,

49
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:22,821
and New Zealand that all have similar
populations and life expectancies.

50
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:25,710
And some of these other
clumps can be differentiated.

51
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,911
For example, West Bank,
and Gaza, and Lithuania

52
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,720
have similar life expectancy
in populations, or

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,350
over here we've got Argentina and Poland.

54
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,127
And so by zooming in on the data,
we can use the resolution available on our

55
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,837
Display Screen to better
differentiate similar items.

56
00:03:50,837 --> 00:03:54,084
And then we can always zoom back if
we want to see where things are in

57
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:55,300
the original context.

58
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:02,992
When we zoom in on a portion of our
plotted data we're ignoring, we're

59
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:09,670
completely ignoring, the portion of the
data that's outside of that zoom window.

60
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,410
Often that can cause us
to get lost in the data.

61
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,300
We're looking at a fine level, and we
forget where that fine level of data that

62
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,640
we're focusing on sits
within the larger dataset.

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,695
So, there are tools that help us to
combine the focus of zooming with

64
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:29,911
the context of the big picture
of the entire dataset.

65
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:31,600
And, these are called lenses.

66
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,890
They're interactive lenses
that you can drag around.

67
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,642
Sometimes they're called magic lenses,
depending on what they show.

68
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,303
And they allow you to zoom in on details.

69
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:44,730
For example, here's a dataset, and
we can drag around this zoom lens.

70
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,150
And it uniformly magnifies
everything underneath it, but

71
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,650
you can still see where you
are relative to the large dataset.

72
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,810
But in this case,
we have a uniform level of magnification,

73
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,070
so the data that's underneath the
periphery of this lens is being obscured.

74
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,800
We're magnifying this portion
of the data but for example,

75
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,765
we've really lost the detail of the region
of data away from that magnified edge.

76
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:12,300
Because it's being obscured
by the magnified data.

77
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,098
There are fisheye distortion
lenses that help fix that problem.

78
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:23,980
In a fisheye lens, you've got a lot of
magnification at the center of the lens.

79
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,660
And as you move away from the center,
you've got less magnification.

80
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,170
And as you get towards the periphery
of the lens, you get no magnification.

81
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:38,070
The magnification goes to one, and so
you basically as you cross the lens,

82
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,712
you don't see any change in magnification.

83
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:46,390
That way we can push away some of
the details from the center, and

84
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,380
we get this seamless transition
from the outer context

85
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,070
into the zoom details
that we're looking at.

86
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,260
In this case, these three spheres,
these three light green spheres,

87
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,130
are the three large spheres that were
basically occluding everything here.

88
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,380
And as we push them away,
because they're away from the center,

89
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,460
we can start to magnify five very,

90
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,840
very small spheres that were being
occluded by these large spheres.

91
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,450
For example, these three spheres
are basically these three spheres.

92
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,240
They're uniformly distributed one,
two, three here, and

93
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,381
you can see that the first sphere here
is farther away than the other two.

94
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:31,075
That's because of the magnification
of this sphere is greater than

95
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:33,160
the magnification of these spheres.

96
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,790
And so the distance is getting
magnified more here than it was here.

97
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,780
And so these fisheye distortion
lenses give us a nice combination

98
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,880
of the ability to zoom in on data, but
to see it in a context of the big picture.

99
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,249
So the D3 JavaScript library
has some good tools for

100
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:59,080
doing a fisheye distortion
that nicely demonstrated.

101
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,047
So here, for example, we have a graph, and

102
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:06,230
you can see that the graph contains
a lot of clusters of nodes.

103
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,140
And it's hard to see what's going on with
all the edges inside those clusters.

104
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,862
But if I put the mouse near it,
than we get a magnification, and

105
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:16,280
you can start to see the differences.

106
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,986
There's still a lot of lines there,
but you can magnify the positions

107
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:25,798
of the nodes, spread the nodes out
with this fisheye distortion lens.

108
00:07:25,798 --> 00:07:28,641
And see what's going on with the edges,

109
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:33,500
while still connecting to the context
of the remainder of the graph.

110
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,210
So you still get your big
picture of the whole graph.

111
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,110
You can zoom in on individual elements.

112
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,270
And later on in the page, they show
an example of how this distortion works.

113
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,640
It's basically creating a small vector
field that offsets the vertices or

114
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,360
pixels, depending on if you're looking
at primitive data, left vertices, or

115
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,290
if you're looking at
image data with pixels.

116
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,390
And then you can do

117
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,000
the lensing to the entire screen
in a rectal-linear way, or

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,960
you can just do it to a small cylindrical
or a small disk-shaped portion.

119
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,981
And here's some other data.

120
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:21,122
In this case, you've got data
that's plotted by area, and

121
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:26,090
there's a lot of overlap, and
a lot of small details and large details.

122
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:32,190
And as you drag over these regions,
by distorting the entire field, then

123
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,680
you can see the intricate relationship
between the data in your focus.

124
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,040
While still maintaining the context
of where that data lies

125
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,776
in the context of the rest of the dataset.

126
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:52,869
So these fisheye lenses provide a nice
compromise of both focus and context.

127
00:08:52,869 --> 00:09:00,220
