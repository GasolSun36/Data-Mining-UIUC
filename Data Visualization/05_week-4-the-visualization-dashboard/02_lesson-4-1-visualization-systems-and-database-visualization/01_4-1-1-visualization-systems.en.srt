1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,637
[SOUND] So in this module we're going to

2
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:11,818
be looking at visualization systems.

3
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:16,739
So before we do that,
we should nail down some concepts.

4
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,701
And so there's going to be several
concepts that we'll need to review and

5
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:24,344
introduce on these visualization
systems that'll be helpful.

6
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:28,114
The first one we've seen before
is information visualization.

7
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:32,445
We've used that as a term to
describe the plotting of data

8
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,275
that uses different coordinates
than what was provided.

9
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:39,978
In information visualization as
opposed to scientific visualization or

10
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:45,359
other domain visualization where the data
comes to you in a more concrete metaphor,

11
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,136
information visualization the information
is much more abstract, and so

12
00:00:50,136 --> 00:00:54,986
the challenge is going to be being able
to take that abstract information and

13
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:58,850
find a concrete metaphor to
communicate it to the viewer, so

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,092
it can be more easily understood.

15
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:03,739
The second is large data visualization.

16
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:08,030
We often hear of big data and
there's also big data visualization.

17
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,160
The focus of big data or large data
visualization is sometimes just on

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,720
the computation mechanics of
handling large data sets.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,500
But we're going to focus specifically on
the visualization of large data, where

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,890
the data is so large that it's visually
overwhelming if you display everything,

21
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,500
and so you have to be very
selective about what you display so

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,760
that you can keep it mentally organized.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,132
And so, we're going to depend on
interactivity, the interactive aspect

24
00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:38,572
of these visualization system
to be able to, over time,

25
00:01:38,572 --> 00:01:43,160
focus on certain elements of our
visualization that we're interested in,

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,958
and to be able to ignore other elements so
that these data sets,

27
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:51,717
which would be very large, don't
overwhelm our cognitive understandings.

28
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:56,712
Third is visual analytics, visual
analytics is an area that grew out of

29
00:01:56,712 --> 00:02:00,462
business analytics and
business intelligence, and

30
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:06,290
it's specifically on visualization, being
able to look at data sets visually and

31
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,285
to be able to analyze them,
draw conclusions from them,

32
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:14,946
and it focuses also on being able to
make a decision based on data and

33
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:20,026
that decision is implied by
the visualization, that the visualization

34
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:25,401
is giving you the insight in order to
make a good decision based on your data.

35
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:30,009
And finally the goal of this week is
to make a visualization dashboard.

36
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,809
We want to be able to organize
the visualizations when we have multiple

37
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:36,510
visualizations and we have a lot of data.

38
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,090
We'll want to be able to produce
a dashboard view that gives you everything

39
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,850
you need in order to be able to make
a good decision based on the data.

40
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,260
So those are some of the terms,

41
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,360
some of the main concepts we use when
we talk about visualization system.

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,034
We start with information
visualization but our goal for

43
00:02:57,034 --> 00:03:01,932
the week is going to be to understand
how to make a visualization dashboard,

44
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:06,239
how to make a visualization system
that we can use to make decisions

45
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:15,411
