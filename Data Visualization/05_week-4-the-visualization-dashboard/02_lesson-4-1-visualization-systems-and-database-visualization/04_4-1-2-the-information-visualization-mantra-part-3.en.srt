1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,646
[SOUND]
So

2
00:00:07,646 --> 00:00:10,620
filtering allows us to remove extraneous.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,800
Zooming is a kind of filter where
remove extraneous data based on

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,480
the plotted coordinates of the data.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,840
When we select a zoom window,

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,660
we chose to focus on some of the data
based on its displayed coordinates and

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,170
to eliminate data outside of a window
based on its displayed coordinates.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,140
That's a kind of filter based on displayed
coordinates, but a filter can be applied

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,206
to other attributes of the data
besides the displayed coordinates.

10
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:44,392
And so in this case,
we've got our plot of all the countries

11
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:48,940
of based on population and
life expectancy.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,349
We can filter out all the countries
that are in other continents and

13
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:56,907
focus just on the countries
that are in say, Africa.

14
00:00:56,907 --> 00:01:01,998
And so by filtering on Africa,
we only plot the countries in Africa and

15
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:06,650
the data is spread out nicely and
there's much less data here.

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,448
So we've got room to be able to plot
the names of the individual countries and

17
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,621
you can start to see the subset of the
larger dataset that corresponds to Africa.

18
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:23,085
And you realize that many of
the countries that have low life

19
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:27,283
expectancy are in Africa,
but also there's a separate

20
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:32,210
band of countries in Africa that
have higher life expectancies.

21
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,473
And by plotting the names, you've now
got room to see more of the details,

22
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:37,903
because of this filter.

23
00:01:37,903 --> 00:01:44,086
You can see that those countries are
the ones located in Northern Africa and

24
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:49,500
there's different ways of selecting
data by applying filters.

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,014
If you have ordinal or nominal data,
for example, continent.

26
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:59,510
Then you can click a check box, you can
show all of the different categories and

27
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,506
select the ones that you want to look
at and the ones that you don't want to

28
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:08,270
be plotted or
if you want to look at quantitative data.

29
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,765
For example, if we want to look at
countries based on gross domestic product

30
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:19,000
or other quantitative fields,
then we can set a range with a minimum and

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,711
a maximum value and filter out
data above or below these extremal

32
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:28,795
values in order to focus on certain
subsets of a quantitative range.

33
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:33,503
So in tableau, it's quite easy to
filter data based on attributes,

34
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:37,830
you would just drag the attribute
into this filter box.

35
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,982
And so in this case,
if we have our countries displayed here

36
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:45,970
differentiated by putting
the country in the marks box,

37
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,889
we may want to filter
the countries based on continent.

38
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,680
And so, I dragged the Region
dimension into the filter box and

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,960
that will filter based on regions.

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,883
And so now since region,
these continents are basically a category,

41
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,814
they're presented to me in check boxes.

42
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:10,241
And so if I want to only look
at a subset of the country say,

43
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,225
Africa, I can just click Africa and
then click OK.

44
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,820
And now I'm only looking at the countries
associated with Africa, the countries

45
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,320
on the continent of Africa and you can
see there's a big differentiation here

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,235
between these countries Entries t
the top and the countries at the bottom.

47
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:33,255
And in fact, we can zoom in a little
bit further to give us more

48
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,295
screen resolution to take a look at them.

49
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:42,025
And then if we want to know what those
countries are, then I can drag country

50
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:48,020
into the label box here and we can get
labels for each one of these countries.

51
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,025
And you can see that the countries
in Northern Africa tend to have

52
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:58,224
a higher life expectancy than
the countries in the rest of Africa.

53
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:03,729
We don't want to overwhelm a display of
a lot of information with further details,

54
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,082
especially when those
details are extraneous and

55
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:11,788
distract us from general trends that
we should be seeing in the data and

56
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:15,700
a very common way of doing
this is with a tool tip.

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,560
If your mouse is sitting over a data item,
then a little pop-up

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,344
window will come up and
give you the detail based on that data.

59
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:30,765
And maybe some items that,
like you can select only that item or

60
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:37,130
you can exclude that item and look at
other operations based on that item.

61
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,821
A second way of finding details
on demand is a field selection.

62
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,992
You can select a field of your dataset and

63
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,375
you can find the data points
that field corresponds to or

64
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:53,890
a certain setting of that field
corresponds to that get highlighted.

65
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,928
And so there's all sorts of interactive
details that you can make available

66
00:04:57,928 --> 00:04:58,504
to a user.

67
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:02,594
You just want to make them available
only when they're requested and

68
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,640
not all at once, so
as to not overwhelm the viewer.

69
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,703
So those are the basic steps for
setting up a good

70
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:15,649
information visualization system to
understand abstract information.

71
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,450
That first step, you want to set up
an overview to see all the data.

72
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,125
The second step is you want to be
able to drill down to the details of

73
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,599
that data by focusing, zooming, filtering.

74
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:31,180
And then that third step, you want to be
able to provide details on your data, but

75
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,630
only when they're requested.

76
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,319
Only details on demand.

77
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:43,841
