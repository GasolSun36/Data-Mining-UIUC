  Week 4: The Visualization Dashboard
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  During this week's module, you will begin to design a visualization system for a large data set. After creating an initial overview of the data set, you'll search for interesting elements in that data set using techniques such as zooming and filtering. Finally, you'll apply techniques you learned from user-interface design to create an effective visualization system.
 </p>

 <p>
  This module should take
  <strong>
   approximately 5 hours
  </strong>
  of dedicated time to complete, with its videos and assignments.

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Design a visualization system for large datasets and dashboards to support informed decision making.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Create an initial overview of a large dataset, and then find interesting elements through zooming, filtering, and requesting details when needed.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Use visualization as a method for forming effective queries that reveal structure in a database.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Apply techniques from user-interface design to create effective visualization systems.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while completing the readings and working on assignments throughout the week.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    How would I use these techniques to design a visualization system or a dashboard for my own datasets?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    For the data cube lessons, consider how the operations would be applied to a very simple database. For example, an image can be stored as a database of pixels, with records of the form (x,y,b) where x,y are the pixel coordinates and b is the pixel's brightness. How would the various data cube visualization methods work on that kind of data?

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this week, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
