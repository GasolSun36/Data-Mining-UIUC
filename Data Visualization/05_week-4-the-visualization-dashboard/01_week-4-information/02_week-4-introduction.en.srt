2
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:11,908
in Module 4 we're going to
look at visualization systems.

3
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:16,718
In Module 2 we learned how to plot data
using coordinates stored in the data.

4
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:19,150
In Module 3 we learned how to plot data

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,720
using coordinates that we had
to compute based on the data.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,328
In Module 4 we're going to focus on
systems that allow the user to decide how

7
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:30,148
they want to plot the data,
what data to plot.

8
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:35,010
It's going to focus on the connection
of the user to the data and

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,911
a visualization system that helps figure
out the best way to plot that data.
