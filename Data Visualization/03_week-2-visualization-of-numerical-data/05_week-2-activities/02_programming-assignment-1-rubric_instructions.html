  <strong>
   Appropriate Chart Selection and Variables
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Did you select the appropriate chart and use the correct chart elements to visualize the nominal, ordinal, discrete, and continuous variables, as described in lecture 2.1.3? Continuous data variables should be assigned to continuous chart elements (e.g., lines between data points), whereas discrete variables should be assigned to discrete chart elements (e.g., separate bars). Furthermore, the assignment of variables to elements should follow the priorities in lecture 2.1.2.

  <strong>
   Design of the Chart
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Does the chart effectively display the data, based on the design rules in lecture 2.3.1?

 <p>
  How interesting is the result? Does this represent an interesting choice of data and/or an interesting way to display the data? For example, was a streamgraph used instead of an ordinary bar chart?
