1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,167
[SOUND] So, data visualization can
consist of some very simple charts,

2
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:13,357
but the success of a data
visualization can often depend on how

3
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:19,208
we map our data variables to
the elements of those charts.

4
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,600
So we can start with a Bar Chart.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,030
And the bar chart has
two axises typically.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,620
You've got a horizontal axis and
a vertical axis.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,000
And you're usually measuring
discrete values here, and

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,210
some either discrete or
continuous value vertically.

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:43,560
And this benefits from the fact
that you're mapping a variable,

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,770
a data variable, to both position,
the actual height of these bars,

11
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,170
as well as to a length,
the size of the bar.

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,040
And so you do a really good
job of not only seeing.

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,310
That, for example, the orange bar
is larger than the blue bar, but

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:05,310
how much larger the orange bar
is to the blue bar because

15
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,980
position and length are both at the top
of perceptual effectiveness for

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,160
displaying quantitative values.

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,840
And so usually vertically we have some
sort of quantitative dependent variable.

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,500
And then horizontally
these can be categories.

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,220
And so we have some nominal variable or
at least some discreet variable here

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,830
indicating the individual
bars that we're plotting.

21
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,040
And this is an independent variable,
a dimension.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,650
And then this is some kind of
measure of that dimension.

23
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,550
It's a dependant variable depending on
the value of this independent variable.

24
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,680
Similarly, you have a line chart.

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,710
A line chart has data points
that are connected by a line.

26
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,280
And so
this is very very similar to a bar chart.

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,660
These data points are at the same
altitude as the tops of the bars.

28
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,910
So they benefit from position but
they don't have the length.

29
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,490
That you visually see with
the bars in a bar chart.

30
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,070
So you still do a pretty good job of

31
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,670
being able to discern quantitative values
and their relationship of quantitative

32
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,540
values in the altitudes of these
data points in a line chart.

33
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,260
And so again we have a quantitative
dependent variable vertically that's

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,220
changing based on some quantitative
independent variable horizontally.

35
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,110
But now the horizontal value is some
quantitative continuous variable and

36
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,600
the vertical value also needs to be
a quantitative continuous variable

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,620
because we're drawing lines between
these data points and these lines imply

38
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,400
that there's a continuity of values
between these data points and

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,320
these data points have a horizontal and
a vertical component.

40
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,060
These lines have a horizontal and
vertical component.

41
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,060
So you don't want to use a line chart to
display data across categories because

42
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,690
that's implying that there's in between
values in between these categories and

43
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,760
if they're nominal categories,
if they're discreet,

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,950
then there should not
be in between values.

45
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,945
Your visualization shouldn't imply
that there's in between being values.

46
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:11,445
If we remove the lines,
we get a scatter plot.

47
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:14,405
And a scatter plot gives
us some other flexibility.

48
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:18,405
When we display a line plot,
we're displaying a function.

49
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:22,020
We're displaying some dependent variable

50
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,790
that's changing according
to an independent variable.

51
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,520
So that there's one dependent value for
every independent value.

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,610
So there's basically one measure for
each change in dimension.

53
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,050
When we do a scatter plot,
we have two independent variables so

54
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,870
that I can have the same
horizontal value here and

55
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:47,630
I can have two values associated with
that and so that can be a powerful value.

56
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,630
You usually don't connect these with
a line unless there is some order in

57
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,880
which the data is coming in that you
want to associate with a line and

58
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,286
that would be an additional dimension
you could indicate on a scatter plot.

59
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:05,230
But the line doesn't infer that
you're plotting a function, because

60
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,270
a scatter plot doesn't plot a function
unless the data's organized that way.

61
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,710
And so you have two independent variables,
a horizontal independent variable and

62
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,960
a vertical independent variable.

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,590
And you're getting an indication of
position, both, horizontally and

64
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:26,140
vertically, for the quantitative
values on each of the two axes.

65
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,977
You also get some cues based on density if
these points tend to cluster in certain

66
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:31,491
areas.

67
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:37,550
You can also create a Gantt Chart,

68
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,518
which is kind of looks like a sideways bar
chart, except the bases of objects don't

69
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:46,130
line up with one of the axises
like they would in a bar chart.

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,160
And so in this case,
we have two independent variables,

71
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,310
things that are no longer
related as a function, but

72
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,150
you still get the benefits of position and
length.

73
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,160
Gantt charts are usually
processed diagrams that tell you

74
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,930
the various stages of a project.

75
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,710
And so horizontally a Gantt chart
would usually be some display of time.

76
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:12,160
This may be a quarter, or
date, or some other time axis.

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,510
And then vertically, this is some
categorical, often a discrete or nominal

78
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,920
independent variable here vertically,
and this is typically the tasks.

79
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,700
So you'll have the first tasks and
then the second task, and

80
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,390
the second task may start
before the first task finishes.

81
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:36,280
And tasks may stop and then start up
again, and so you get this overlap.

82
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,770
Again, it benefits from both position and
length.

83
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,470
but it operates from two
independent variables.

84
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,610
Again one could be quantitative and one
could be nominal similarly to a bar chart.

85
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,740
But in a bar chart you have
one dependent variable

86
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,300
plotted over an independent variable.

87
00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,850
In a Gantt chart you have to independent
variables And, finally, you have a table.

88
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,790
In this case, you have two nominal
variables, two categories,

89
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,430
for example,
they're independent variables.

90
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,270
One doesn't depend on
the other necessarily and

91
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,850
you're just looking at two
separate dimensions, and

92
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:23,220
in plotting some value that would be
the entry in each of these table entries.

93
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,600
So it really benefits from position only,
and again, that position is discrete or

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,220
nominal.

95
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,080
It's not a continuous position,
as it would be in a scatter plot.

96
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,670
It's in discrete, quantized regions.

97
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,560
You might also notice if you
look at this long enough,

98
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,380
you can see some flashing
happening at the intersections.

99
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,330
And it's, again, important to
remember your perceptual psychology

100
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,800
to know when you're laying these
things out to pay attention to

101
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,780
contrast to make sure that you don't
get some unwanted perceptual features.

102
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,620
So here's a table that
visualizes the decision

103
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,370
you need to make of what chart
to use in various situations,

104
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,310
depending on the data
that you want to display.

105
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,820
Very often you have at least one
independent variable and then you

106
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,760
may have a dependent variable on it or
you may have an independent variable.

107
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,840
And your independent variable might be
discreet or nominal, some category,

108
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,750
or it might be some some quantity
tha varies continuously and

109
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,640
your dependent value could similarly be
continuous or discrete, or an independent

110
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:47,310
variable could be a category, or
it could be a continuously changing value.

111
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,340
Independent of your horizontal axis,
and so depending on each

112
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,700
of these configurations you could look
up in this table which you want to use.

113
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,560
If you have an independent variable and

114
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,450
a dependent variable, then most
often you want to use a bar chart.

115
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,370
You can use a line chart, but only when
you have a continuous dependent variable

116
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,270
and a continuous independent variable,
because the lines indicate

117
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,670
that they're in between values
both horizontally and vertically.

118
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:21,025
You want to use a Gantt chart if
you have a independent variable.

119
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:26,840
That's continuous and
a categorical axis vertically or

120
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,310
a categorical axis horizontally and
a continuous value vertically.

121
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,030
Either one of those will
form a Gantt chart.

122
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,740
If you have two categorical axes,
you want to make a table.

123
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,570
And if you have two continuous
axes that are both independent,

124
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,740
you want to make a scatter plot.

125
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,590
So we use the kind of data that
we're trying to visualize nominal,

126
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,610
ordered, quantitative,
whether it's continuous,

127
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,810
whether it's discreet, whether
variables are dependent or independent.

128
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,250
To not only figure out how they
map to chart elements, but

129
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,914
more importantly to decide
which chart best displays them.

130
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:18,925
