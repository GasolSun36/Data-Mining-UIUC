[MUSIC] So when we map data,
we figure out how to convert the data into some graphics primitive that
we can display, and that conversion is going to depend on how we perceive
different graphical objects and connect their characteristics to
the characteristics of the data. So, as we saw before, the data visualization framework
has this mapping layer. And this mapping layer takes
data in our data collection, and takes its abstract data values, and assigns them more concrete geometric
values, and those geometric values are used by the graphics layer
to display the data for visualization. So there's been some studies in
the 80s that basically uncovered how effective different
geometric mappings are in the perception of quantitative
values that they're mapped to. So, for example, we have this list here,
and it's sorted by perceptual accuracy. So when we see data Indicated by mapping to position,
we do a better job of understanding the quantities than we do
if the data is mapped to color or density. So, if we have data varying
along the horizontal axis here, we can map the data to position. And we can see that the right
bar is farther along. It's higher than the left bar. It's got a greater position. And, in fact, we can see how
much greater the position is. We can also see it from length, and
the right bar is longer than the left bar. And these are very good methods for
displaying quantitative data. And you can see that if you
combine the two of these, you basically get
the elements of a bar chart. Similarly, you can map data to angle or
slope, and you can see that this right angle
is greater than this left angle. That's a little bit less effective, but these are the elements that you would see
in a pie chart, and pie charts are just a little less effective at displaying
quantitative data than are bar charts. You can also map data to area. And so the circle on the right is
smaller than the circle on the left. It represents a smaller area. It's just a little harder to
figure out how much smaller the circle on the right is
than the circle on the left. And you can also map to volume,
and so the sphere on the right represents a smaller volume than
the sphere on the left, but it's even more difficult to figure out
how much smaller the volume is here in the orange sphere on the right than
it is for the blue sphere on the left. And finally, color or density. In this case,
we have two equal size spheres. This sphere on the right is lighter,
and the sphere on the left is darker. It's just difficult to know how much
lighter the sphere on the right is, compared to the sphere on the left. So it's interesting to note that,
as we move farther down the list and find less effective ways of mapping
data to geometric or spatial values, that we move from one-dimensional
values of position, length, angle, and
slope to two-dimensional values, or three-dimensional values,
of area or volume. And when we get to color or density, we're no longer talking
about spatial values at all. These are non-spatial values. And so further studies have investigated
this at a finer level of detail and expanded that list. Again, we have position and
length being the most effective representations of data for
spatially, or geometrically. But, for example, angle and
slope have been divided so that angle is slightly better than slope
for discerning quantitative values. And, finally, density has been expanded
to density, saturation, and hue, so we've basically got brightness,
the intensity of a color, how saturated it is,
how brilliant the color is, and then which color you actually
pick in the color wheel. So these are all representing, and these
are consistent with the previous study, representing quantitative values that
you may want to display geometrically or spatially. We can also display other values. For example, ordinal values,
values, again, that you'll want to map
to a visual display. In ordinal's case,
instead of quantitative, we don't know how much greater
one value is to another. We just know that one value is bigger than
another or greater than another value. For example, shirt sizes. We know that medium shirt is
larger than a small shirt. We just don't know how much larger. So for ordinal data,
position still wins out, so position is still at the top of the
list for indicating ordinal data values. But then we have density, saturation, and
hue second, third, and fourth in the list. So whereas the brightness of a color,
or how intense the color is, or which color you pick, it's difficult
to make actual quantitative comparisons. It is actually quite easy to
make the comparison itself. You can tell when one object is
brighter than another object, you just don't know how
much brighter it is. And then the remainder of
these stays in the same order, it just falls further down on the list. So length, angle, slope, area, and
volume are a little bit less effective at looking at relative orders of things
that don't have quantitative values. And this gap here is filled in with
some geometric mappings that don't make sense for quantitative values, things
like texture, connection, and containment. And so we wouldn't think of one texture
as being different, quantitatively, than another texture, but you can make
value judgments between textures, and so this is more textured than this is. You can make connections between objects,
and these two objects are connected and
this one isn't, and that sets up an ordering that's
not necessarily quantitative. And finally, containment, the fact that
one object contains another object, and a third object is not
contained by that object, is another ordinal organization that
doesn't make sense for quantitative data. And finally, there's a third category
of data we can look at, nominal. These are categories of data. Ordinals are values that we can compare,
but that we don't know how much
greater one is to another. With nominal values, these
are categories that aren't comparable, things like comparing
a square to a circle. A square isn't greater than a circle or
less than a circle. They're just different. And so, again, position is still the strongest indicator of difference for
nominal data values, but then what would ordinarily be second? Density, saturation, hue,
texture, connection, and containment remains as powerful for
nominal axes, except that hue and texture become stronger, and the rest
of these become a little bit weaker. And so hue, the actual color in a color
wheel, is a good indicator of category, even though it's a very poor
indicator of actual quantities. And then, finally, length,
angle, slope, volume, and area end up being similarly poor for describing categories as they are for
describing base sizes. There's an additional value here that you
can map categories to shape, so you can map nominal data to shape, and I've been
using shape as an example of nominal data, circle, square, and so on, and that's more
effective than mapping categories to, for example, the length or
angle of geometry. So we've learned that there's many
different ways of connecting our data to different graphics attributes
when we display data graphically for data visualization, and we've learned that
some of these ways are better perceived than others depending on whether the data
is nominal, ordered, or quantitative. [MUSIC]
