2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,240
So we understand how a computer works.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,740
We understand how a human works.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,680
Now we need to understand the data.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,490
The different kinds of data and

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,400
how data works its way through
a data visualization system.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,870
And so there's a Data Visualization
Framework that helps us

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,110
understand how data is processed for
visualization.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,180
First, data's available to us
from a variety of sources, so

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,750
there's a Data Collection operation.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,360
That basically combines the data from
a bunch of different sources and

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,770
processes it into one package for
visualization.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,600
Then there is a Mapping Layer,
this mapper that takes the data, and

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,820
the data's abstract and whatever
computational representation it may be in,

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,380
and it converts it into some
geometric representation,

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,000
something concrete, that then
a Graphics Layer can take and display.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,967
And that prepares it for
visualization, for

18
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:06,350
communication across this visual
channel for human perception.

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,441
So the Data Layer Is responsible for
finding the data,

20
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:15,180
collecting the data
from different sources.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,960
Making sure those sources, which may
have the data in different formats,

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,710
that the data can be combined
into a uniform data store.

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:29,820
And making sure that the data is related
between different sources properly.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,860
And then there's some analysis and
aggregation to run statistics on the data,

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,800
make sure the data is collected
at the right frequency.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,500
And then that data, once it's in a single
package, is sent to the Mapping Layer,

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,200
which assigns the geometry to
corresponding data channels, and

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,950
can also perform other rather
sophisticated data processing operations,

29
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:00,020
things like contouring which take grid
samples and convert them into outlines

30
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,290
of contours that can be useful for
understanding what's going on in the data.

31
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,680
And finally, there's a Graphics Layer and

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,330
this converts the geometry into
a displayable image as we saw last week.

33
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,040
It applies Decorations to the geometry.

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,320
It assigns color.

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,840
It shades the geometry.

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,690
It's also responsible for
managing the interactions.

37
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,000
The user input during the visualization.

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,760
So that's the framework for
data visualization.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,500
As we look at the actual data involved and
that mapping operation,

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,180
it's important to understand some
fundamental features of data,

41
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,070
the types of data that are out there.

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,140
And so data can either be Discrete or
Continuous.

43
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,240
Discrete data has Discrete values,
there's no between values.

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,110
Whereas Continuous data has values between
neighboring values that are possible.

45
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:04,860
And then there's comparable data so that
the data can be compared to each other or

46
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,070
Unordered data where
the values are not comparable.

47
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,970
So we look at all the possibilities of
Discrete and Continuous data of Ordered

48
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,490
and Unordered, and you get the different
kinds of data that you'll be dealing with.

49
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,580
For example, Ordinal data.

50
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,870
Ordinal data is data that's ordered,
but discreet.

51
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,850
Things like shirt sizes.

52
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,540
You can say a medium shirt is going
to be larger than a small shirt or

53
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,430
a large shirt is going to be
smaller than a medium shirt.

54
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,760
But there may not be values of
a shirt size between medium and large.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,890
And these can be quantitative
which are discrete and ordered.

56
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,020
For example the counting numbers one,
two, three.

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,930
There's not one point five.

58
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,518
So there's no value between 1 and
2 in our counting numbers.

59
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:59,040
So they're discrete, but yet
2 is greater than 1 so they're ordered.

60
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,150
And so those are examples
of discrete Ordered values.

61
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,450
You can have Continuous Ordered values,
and

62
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,490
these are common real numbers,
the real number line and so on.

63
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,000
and values that we'd use, for example,
for altitude or temperature or

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,570
any continuous field of values.

65
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,560
You can also have Unordered data
in discrete and continuous forms.

66
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,090
The discrete form of Unordered data
can be Nominal or Categorical.

67
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,890
Things like shapes
are examples of nominal data.

68
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,360
They're not ordered.

69
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,270
A square, circle and a triangle.

70
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,190
You wouldn't say that
the square is greater than or

71
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,590
less than a circle,
because there's no order between them.

72
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,560
You could have categories.

73
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,950
Different nationalities, or
other other categories for

74
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,770
data that may not necessarily be
comparable and those are discreet.

75
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,400
You can also have continuous
values that are Unordered

76
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,260
often Cyclic values are like this so
directions or

77
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,410
cues, you wouldn't say that north
is any greater or less than east.

78
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,860
And you can having angle going from 0 to
360 in degrees but after you get a 360

79
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:21,850
degrees, you go back to 0 degrees and so
any one is not greater than any other.

80
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,735
And then hues you could have red,
green, yellow, blue and

81
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:30,086
you may not say that red is any
greater than green and so these values

82
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:34,905
are continuous there are colors between
red and green, but you wouldn't

83
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:40,060
think of red as being greater than or
less than green, so they're unordered.

84
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,544
And finally, when we're treating
data as variables, in science,

85
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:52,440
you may recall Independent Variables and
Dependent Variables.

86
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,880
And when Independent Variables change,

87
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,070
they can have an effect
on Dependent Variables.

88
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,970
That same notion happens in the data
we get from, for example, Databases.

89
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,730
And so you'll have Key Value pairs, and

90
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:12,150
Databases will store an index and
then a value associated with that index.

91
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,520
And as the Key changes
the resulting value will change.

92
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,630
So you have this Independent,
Dependent relationship.

93
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:25,240
In Data Warehouses the Independent
Variable is often a Dimension,

94
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,170
something that's changing
that represents Dimension.

95
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,180
And then the Dependent Variable
is a measure that's happening

96
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,710
as a result of that Dimension.

97
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,270
So a dimension might be time, and

98
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,660
then the measure might be
the temperature at that time of the day.

99
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,750
And so as the time of the day changes,

100
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,970
which is an Independent Variable,
you would have a Dependent Variable,

101
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,310
the Measure, being the temperature
at that time of the day changing.

102
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,240
And you can store that in a Database
as a bunch of times of the day and

103
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,510
then the temperature at that time of
the day as a bunch of Key Value pairs.

104
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:06,120
And so the data is basically stored
in these Independent, Dependent

105
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,350
relationships in a variety of names
depending on the context of the data.

106
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,950
So the important thing to remember,
the three fundamental kinds of data.

107
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,900
There's Nominal data, there's Ordered
data, and there's Quantitative data.

108
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,101
And we'll be using those distinctions when
we determine how that data ends up being

109
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:28,090
displayed in a visualization system.

110
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,600
