2
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:11,881
So when we map data,
we figure out how to convert the data

3
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:16,758
into some graphics primitive that
we can display, and that conversion

4
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:21,472
is going to depend on how we perceive
different graphical objects and

5
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:26,210
connect their characteristics to
the characteristics of the data.

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,050
So, as we saw before,

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,500
the data visualization framework
has this mapping layer.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,671
And this mapping layer takes
data in our data collection, and

9
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,480
takes its abstract data values, and

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,660
assigns them more concrete geometric
values, and those geometric

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,390
values are used by the graphics layer
to display the data for visualization.

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,310
So there's been some studies in
the 80s that basically uncovered

13
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,610
how effective different
geometric mappings are in

14
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,830
the perception of quantitative
values that they're mapped to.

15
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,580
So, for example, we have this list here,
and it's sorted by perceptual accuracy.

16
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,800
So when we see data

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,980
Indicated by mapping to position,
we do a better job

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,640
of understanding the quantities than we do
if the data is mapped to color or density.

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,145
So, if we have data varying
along the horizontal axis here,

20
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:31,508
we can map the data to position.

21
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,709
And we can see that the right
bar is farther along.

22
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,730
It's higher than the left bar.

23
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,990
It's got a greater position.

24
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,930
And, in fact, we can see how
much greater the position is.

25
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,800
We can also see it from length, and
the right bar is longer than the left bar.

26
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,160
And these are very good methods for
displaying quantitative data.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,440
And you can see that if you
combine the two of these,

28
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,410
you basically get
the elements of a bar chart.

29
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:04,330
Similarly, you can map data to angle or
slope,

30
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,280
and you can see that this right angle
is greater than this left angle.

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,120
That's a little bit less effective, but

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,730
these are the elements that you would see
in a pie chart, and pie charts are just

33
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,359
a little less effective at displaying
quantitative data than are bar charts.

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,620
You can also map data to area.

35
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,400
And so the circle on the right is
smaller than the circle on the left.

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,520
It represents a smaller area.

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,230
It's just a little harder to
figure out how much smaller

38
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,390
the circle on the right is
than the circle on the left.

39
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,520
And you can also map to volume,
and so the sphere on the right

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,850
represents a smaller volume than
the sphere on the left, but

41
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,090
it's even more difficult to figure out
how much smaller the volume is here

42
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,780
in the orange sphere on the right than
it is for the blue sphere on the left.

43
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,190
And finally, color or density.

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,370
In this case,
we have two equal size spheres.

45
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,580
This sphere on the right is lighter,
and the sphere on the left is darker.

46
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,615
It's just difficult to know how much
lighter the sphere on the right is,

47
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,127
compared to the sphere on the left.

48
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:11,816
So it's interesting to note that,
as we move farther down the list and

49
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:16,825
find less effective ways of mapping
data to geometric or spatial values,

50
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:21,350
that we move from one-dimensional
values of position, length,

51
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,824
angle, and
slope to two-dimensional values, or

52
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:28,730
three-dimensional values,
of area or volume.

53
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,699
And when we get to color or density,

54
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:33,729
we're no longer talking
about spatial values at all.

55
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:37,932
These are non-spatial values.

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,547
And so further studies have investigated
this at a finer level of detail and

57
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,220
expanded that list.

58
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,310
Again, we have position and
length being the most effective

59
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,630
representations of data for
spatially, or geometrically.

60
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,070
But, for example, angle and
slope have been divided so

61
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,840
that angle is slightly better than slope
for discerning quantitative values.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,790
And, finally, density has been expanded
to density, saturation, and hue, so

63
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,460
we've basically got brightness,
the intensity of a color,

64
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,750
how saturated it is,
how brilliant the color is, and

65
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,920
then which color you actually
pick in the color wheel.

66
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:26,800
So these are all representing, and these
are consistent with the previous study,

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,230
representing quantitative values that
you may want to display geometrically or

68
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,970
spatially.

69
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,830
We can also display other values.

70
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,880
For example, ordinal values,
values, again,

71
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:44,260
that you'll want to map
to a visual display.

72
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,250
In ordinal's case,
instead of quantitative,

73
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,110
we don't know how much greater
one value is to another.

74
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,210
We just know that one value is bigger than
another or greater than another value.

75
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,650
For example, shirt sizes.

76
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,260
We know that medium shirt is
larger than a small shirt.

77
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,620
We just don't know how much larger.

78
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,850
So for ordinal data,
position still wins out,

79
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,320
so position is still at the top of the
list for indicating ordinal data values.

80
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,360
But then we have density, saturation, and
hue second, third, and fourth in the list.

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,440
So whereas the brightness of a color,
or how intense the color is,

82
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,170
or which color you pick, it's difficult
to make actual quantitative comparisons.

83
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,530
It is actually quite easy to
make the comparison itself.

84
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,330
You can tell when one object is
brighter than another object,

85
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,010
you just don't know how
much brighter it is.

86
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,160
And then the remainder of
these stays in the same order,

87
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,970
it just falls further down on the list.

88
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,440
So length, angle, slope, area, and
volume are a little bit less effective at

89
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,590
looking at relative orders of things
that don't have quantitative values.

90
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:07,270
And this gap here is filled in with
some geometric mappings that don't

91
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,978
make sense for quantitative values, things
like texture, connection, and containment.

92
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:18,415
And so we wouldn't think of one texture
as being different, quantitatively,

93
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:23,750
than another texture, but you can make
value judgments between textures, and

94
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,230
so this is more textured than this is.

95
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,430
You can make connections between objects,
and

96
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,840
these two objects are connected and
this one isn't, and

97
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,390
that sets up an ordering that's
not necessarily quantitative.

98
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,030
And finally, containment, the fact that
one object contains another object, and

99
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,350
a third object is not
contained by that object,

100
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,810
is another ordinal organization that
doesn't make sense for quantitative data.

101
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,920
And finally, there's a third category
of data we can look at, nominal.

102
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,420
These are categories of data.

103
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,070
Ordinals are values that we can compare,
but

104
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,560
that we don't know how much
greater one is to another.

105
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,080
With nominal values, these
are categories that aren't comparable,

106
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,420
things like comparing
a square to a circle.

107
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,700
A square isn't greater than a circle or
less than a circle.

108
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,726
They're just different.

109
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:21,930
And so, again, position is still

110
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,928
the strongest indicator of difference for
nominal data values,

111
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:30,970
but then what would ordinarily be second?

112
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,680
Density, saturation, hue,
texture, connection, and

113
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,050
containment remains as powerful for
nominal axes, except that hue and

114
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,920
texture become stronger, and the rest
of these become a little bit weaker.

115
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,300
And so hue, the actual color in a color
wheel, is a good indicator of category,

116
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,620
even though it's a very poor
indicator of actual quantities.

117
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,240
And then, finally, length,
angle, slope, volume, and

118
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,810
area end up being similarly poor for

119
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:08,220
describing categories as they are for
describing base sizes.

120
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,870
There's an additional value here that you
can map categories to shape, so you can

121
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,980
map nominal data to shape, and I've been
using shape as an example of nominal data,

122
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,880
circle, square, and so on, and that's more
effective than mapping categories to,

123
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,070
for example, the length or
angle of geometry.

124
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,324
So we've learned that there's many
different ways of connecting our

125
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:40,037
data to different graphics attributes
when we display data graphically for

126
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:45,338
data visualization, and we've learned that
some of these ways are better perceived

127
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:50,597
than others depending on whether the data
is nominal, ordered, or quantitative.

128
