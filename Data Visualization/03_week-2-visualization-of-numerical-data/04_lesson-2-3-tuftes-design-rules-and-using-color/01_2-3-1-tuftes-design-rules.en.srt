2
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:14,126
So some of the rules of visual design
can help take a data visualization and

3
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:15,920
make it more appealing so
that people will want to look at it and

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,585
investigate it more.

5
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:22,049
We don't have time to go into
all the rules of visual design,

6
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:29,336
but I can basically summarize a few of the
rules that have come from Edward Tufte,

7
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:33,543
who's written several
books on the subject.

8
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:37,560
The first one is to let the data speak.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,010
It's very easy when we're collecting
data and doing our data processing.

10
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,840
To smooth our data,
to try to remove outliers and

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,130
try to fill in missing data gaps and
so on.

12
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,320
Sometimes it's best just to display
the data and let human reasoning,

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,390
the reasoning of our cognitive systems
be able to take care of those details.

14
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,640
For example, here's life expectancy data
for two countries, Belize and Bermuda.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,510
Belize has data for
all the years from 1960 to 2012 and

16
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,880
Bermuda is missing a lot of data.

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,662
It's got a lot of gaps
here until the year 2000.

18
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:20,100
And so I could have filled this in with

19
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,400
plausible data or
drawn lines between these.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,020
But it's better to just let your
inductive system fill these in with

21
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,700
what you would expect to be
between these data points.

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,890
And also to let your abductive reasoning
try to figure out why the data wasn't

23
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,930
being gathered in these gaps.

24
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,582
Another design rule is that
a picture's worth a thousand words.

25
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:51,200
So you can often show with a diagram or

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
a picture things that it would
take a lot of text to describe.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,790
This is a very old illustration.

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,860
It's a visualization by Charles Minard
in 1869 of Napoleon's army

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,010
as it's marching towards Moscow.

30
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,120
And the width of this line
is the size of the army.

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,550
And it gets to Moscow, and

32
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,360
it's withered down to a small size
compared to what it started with.

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,915
And then it begins a retreat.

34
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:20,070
The size of the army becomes even smaller,

35
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,770
in part because of the falling
temperatures which are plotted down here.

36
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:31,260
It may take a lot of text or annotation in
order to describe what the army size was.

37
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,210
But you can see visually here,
based on this pictorially,

38
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,500
what's going on a lot better and
in a smaller space.

39
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,470
With that said, even though you
can say a lot with pictures,

40
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,700
you still need to say a lot with words.

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,560
Most importantly you should
not forget to label your axes.

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,350
It's very important to label your axes.

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,460
Here's a couple diagrams from some of my
own publications where we're plotting

44
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,880
various data or various behaviors.

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,700
You can see there's a lot of attention
that needs to go into annotations to not

46
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,060
only make sure that the reader
understands what's being plotted,

47
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,480
but also understands
the semantics behind the graph.

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,850
What bars at this altitude
versus this altitude mean?

49
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,080
What this line means here
versus this line here?

50
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,490
So annotation words are still
important to visualization and

51
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,010
it's the relationship
between the words and

52
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,250
the geometry often that gets
the job done in a visualization.

53
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,320
You can also add too much
information to a visualization.

54
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,790
Tufte's advice is encapsulated
nicely in the term chart junk.

55
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,100
Which basically says that when you try to
make a visualization look prettier and

56
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,760
add a lot of elements to a visualization,
those elements can detract from

57
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,640
the actual message that the visualization
is trying to provide to the observer.

58
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,220
Very commonly three dimensions can make a
two-dimensional graph look more engaging.

59
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,570
This three-dimensional graph looks
nicer than this two dimensional graph.

60
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,690
But as we've seen with perspective,
if I've got a bar that's farther away,

61
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,920
if I have a bar in the forefront and
a bar in the background,

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,070
sometimes it can be difficult to see if
a bar in the background is shorter because

63
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,490
it's farther away or is it shorter because
it's representing a smaller amount?

64
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,230
So it's better to avoid three dimensions.

65
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,420
And it's better to avoid adding a lot
of extraneous details to a chart that

66
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,020
may make it look more engaging but
could detract from its real message.

67
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,987
A nice quantitative measure of
chart junk is the data-ink ratio.

68
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:59,860
The data-ink ratio basically states that

69
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,250
how much data are you displaying
in your visualization

70
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,280
divided by how much ink are you
using in the visualization.

71
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,275
So, you want to maximize
the data-ink ratio.

72
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:17,170
Meaning, you want to display as much
data as possible using as little ink

73
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:17,880
as possible.

74
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:25,362
So for example, here's a perfectly
good bar chart displaying some item

75
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:31,490
in units of one, two, three,
four, and five unit gaps there.

76
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,140
I can display the exact same thing
without these horizontal lines,

77
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,830
without even the annotations here on the
left, because the annotations are changing

78
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,530
by counting numbers one,
two, three, four, and five.

79
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,330
I can just display them as
stacked discreet bar segments and

80
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,870
I can see the same information that

81
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,810
this is basically some value
a little more than four.

82
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,840
This is some value a bit larger than two.

83
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,290
I can see the same information here,

84
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,640
I've used less ink and
I can focus more on the actual data.

85
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:14,630
This is an example where Ed Tufte
reveals that he's really a minimalist.

86
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:20,210
He wants as little decoration
as possible in visualizations.

87
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,370
There are other people working
in visualization who have set up

88
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,900
different design aesthetics that have
also generated effective visualizations.

89
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,780
So Tufte is not the only name in
visualization and the only advice you

90
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,330
should follow, but these are good
recommendations in any case.

91
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,330
Another principle is the micro and
the macro of a visualization.

92
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,610
So you've got micro level details and
macro level details.

93
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,310
The best example is, again, from the NCSA,
here's another visualization of a tornado.

94
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,950
On the bottom here we've got
wind being displayed, perhaps,

95
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,420
as little stalks of wheat.

96
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,320
You can see wind direction
here in the foreground and

97
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,360
in the background that
becomes more of a texture.

98
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,640
So you've got micro-level and
macro-level details.

99
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,660
We can create zoomable interfaces.

100
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,570
Zoomable interfaces allow us to change

101
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,420
which details are at the macro
level that we can look at, and

102
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,660
which details are at the micro level
which we can get a broad overview of.

103
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,150
This leads to this mantra for

104
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,360
doing large data visualization, where you
want to see a broad overview first, and

105
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,240
then get the details on demand, and
be able to zoom into those details,

106
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,502
and be able to switch from
a macro view to a micro view.

107
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:50,930
It's also

108
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,510
to think of information as
being organized into layers.

109
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:01,560
This is a visualization project that I was
a part of a few years ago, where we were

110
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,500
visualizing the structure of music in a
different layout than is usual for music.

111
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,110
So we're visualizing, for example,
note values here in blue and

112
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,440
we're visualizing similar chord
structures in black characters.

113
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,720
And I'm showing some relationships in
light grey of neighboring elements to

114
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,750
a given relationship organized
in heavy black here.

115
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,680
So by using these different design
elements, changing the color,

116
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,390
changing typeface, italics or bold,

117
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,520
you can organize the visual display
of information a little bit better,

118
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,180
give hints to the viewer of
the different categories.

119
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,280
This is very similar to the display
of nominal data using hue,

120
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:56,140
for example, or
using a different type face, or

121
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:02,700
a different decoration as a way of
discriminating between nominal variable.

122
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,186
Also multiples, Tufte speaks of multiples.

123
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:13,520
That is to basically maintain
a consistent design and

124
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,850
have multiple visualizations using
that same consistent design so

125
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,330
that you can see the differences
as the data changes.

126
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:28,990
So in this example from one of my own
papers we have several different graphs.

127
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,785
In each case, I've tried to maintain
the exact same the same vertical axis.

128
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:38,895
The same annotation for
the different cases.

129
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:43,875
And, in fact, as much as possible,
the same horizontal axis, although it

130
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:49,055
changes a little bit, so that you can
see the difference from graph to graph

131
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:54,380
in addition to the individual changes in
the data variables inside each graph.

132
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,700
Visualizations, especially

133
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,800
presentation visualization and
interactive storytelling, tell a story.

134
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,800
So you might think, what sort of story is
your data visualization actually telling?

135
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,501
The best way to think of this is,
what's happening over time?

136
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:18,931
What's happening across space?

137
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:21,601
Here is a plot of life
expectancy in Rwanda and

138
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,790
the neighboring Republic of Congo.

139
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:29,320
And you see this huge dip in
the life expectancy in Rwanda.

140
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,240
This is just tragic and
a lot's going on here.

141
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,290
These two lines are telling quite
a story because they're describing two

142
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,290
neighboring countries and very different
circumstances in the two countries.

143
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,670
And finally, color.

144
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,290
Your choice of color can be
important if it's used properly, but

145
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,707
color chosen arbitrarily
can be quite harmful.

146
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:59,160
In this example, rainbow is not the best.

147
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,760
As we'll see next, the choice of
color could be very important and

148
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,730
there's additional design decisions to
be made based on the choice of color.

149
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,470
Here we're looking at
a three-dimensional object and

150
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,630
we're using a rainbow map that
has bright and dark spots in it.

151
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,330
Those bright and

152
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,370
dark spots can interfere with our
perception of the three-dimensional shape.

153
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,600
Also the shading of the three-dimensional
shape can interfere

154
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,430
with our perception of the variable
that's being mapped to color.

155
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,040
So these rules came from Tufte's books.

156
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,720
Tufte tends to be a minimalist.

157
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,560
He tends to want to use the least amount

158
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,650
of presentation possible
in a visualization.

159
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,180
And that's one design criterion.

160
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,440
But it's only one of
many design criterions.

161
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,862
I encourage you to look at other
visualizations from other designers and

162
00:11:55,862 --> 00:12:00,188
to maybe explore your own
sense of design style.

163
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:10,188
