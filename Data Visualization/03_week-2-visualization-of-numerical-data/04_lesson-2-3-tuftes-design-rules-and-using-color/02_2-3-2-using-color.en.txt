[SOUND] So we often use color
in data visualization. And it's important to understand how
best to use color to trigger perceptual cues and other ways of sensing the data. These rules have come from Colin Ware's
book on information visualization. As we're picking out colors, it's often
better to think of colors not in their component values that are used to store
them in the computer, basically red, green, and blue, or
a certain portion of red, green, and blue. It's better to think of them in a more
natural set of three components. Basically hue, saturation, and value. Hue is basically where the color
is in the color wheel. Is it red, yellow, green, cyan, blue,
or magenta, or some place in between. Saturation is how intense a color is, what is its distance from a dull grey
to a vibrant version of that hue. And then value is how bright the color is,
its distance from black. And so if you're given a color in RGB,
there's a little bit of code here that would show you
what the color should be in HSV. And a similar color space is used any time
you're picking colors in applications. For example, in Microsoft applications
you get this color space, where hue is shown horizontally as we go from red to yellow,
to green, to cyan, to blue, to magenta, and back to red, and
then saturation is vertically. And we're moving from a gray
through some muted versions of the hues all the way to the full
intensity versions of the hues here. And so you're picking your hue and
your saturation here in this space. And then value is kind of denoted here, going from black to full intensity,
and in this case it's going to white. This isn't quite a value axis,
but it's very closely related. So, hues as we've seen before,
hues are a good choice for representing nominal variables,
for representing categories. And we've seen that five or ten hues
are quite effective in visualizations. You don't want to have too many colors. But five to ten different hues can
be quite effective at denoting, at mapping different values
of a nominal variable. There's as many as twelve colors,
twelve good colors that you can pick from that are based on Ward's extension
of some work by Berlin and Kay. And so, there's the main six colors,
white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. And these are uniformly
chosen across cultures as being good different colors,
basic colors. To that you can add six more colors. Grey, pink, orange,
brown, purple, and cyan. And so this is a good choice, starting
with the first six and then picking colors from the next six, if you need good
colors to map to a nominal variable. Saturation is helpful when you're mapping
various elements of a visualization. You want to use fully saturated colors for
small things in a visualization, if you have a thin line,
you want to use a fully saturated color. It's easier to see this saturated
red-orange and a saturated blue than a desaturated red-orange and
a desaturated blue on these two lines. Both, with a white background,
or a black background, it's still easier to see the saturated
lines than the desaturated lines. You want to use desaturated colors for
fills, so you want saturated strokes and desaturated fills. And so here's bar graph with blue and
orange using desaturated blue and orange, you can still see the differences. When you have saturated large fills,
the aesthetic can be a bit harsh and also it could be a little bit distracting. So it's better to have desaturated
fills and saturated strokes. It's also important to pay
attention to contrast. You want to use brighter colors
in order to gain attention. So here, for example I've got desaturated
bars, and I've got one saturated bar in case I want to draw attention to this
particular data value in a visualization. And then you want to pay
attention to brightness contrast, not just color contrast. So, contrast means a difference. Ordinarily contrast deals
with luminance or brightness. And you look at the brightness of one
color versus the brightness of another color, or the value of one color versus
the value of another color. But you also want to make sure
there's good luminance contrast. Color contrast is often just
a difference in hue, but not necessarily
a difference in brightness. Here I've got orange text
on top of a blue hue, and I'm just changing the saturation and value of this blue hue from black
to full intensity to white. And you can see that even though
there's sufficient color contrast, there's differences in the color, there's
not much difference in the brightness here and it becomes very difficult to read. And so you want to make sure you
maintain good brightness contrast, value contrast,
in addition to just color contrast. So the recommended usage,
you don't want to use colors to represent quantitative
variables when you want to measure the difference between
neighboring values in a visualization. It is a good indication, we can use
density to represent brightness or value, and
then we have saturation and hue. It is good for ordinal variables, so
we can tell that one color is brighter than another color, we can tell that one
color is different than another color, or closer to, for example,
red, or by different hues, or we can tell that one color is
more intense than another color. So these are good for ordinal variables even though we can't
tell how much different they would be. And for categories,
hue is an excellent choice for categories. Changing the value or the brightness,
or changing the saturation. How grey a color is versus
how intense is not as good a differentiator of categories. So the horizontal axis of a bar graph, you don't necessarily want the bars
to be going between grayer and brighter, but it is good to have them
be different colors, different hues. You can use color maps to
represent quantitative values, and this is a very common thing to do. We see it in weather maps all the time,
for example, when we're displaying the temperature
in a geographic region. The choice of colormaps
can be problematic. And so as we saw before in this
three-dimensional visualization, we're just using an ordinary
rainbow colormap. It's darker here, it's a little dark here,
and it's brighter here and here. And those changes in brightness
in the colors chosen for the colormap can interfere with
the perception of light and shadow used to get the orientation
of the surfaces here. And it looks like this blue area is
darker than it should be by the shading. And it looks like this skull has
a divot here when it actually doesn't. So it's best to avoid brightness and
saturation variations in a colormap for illuminated three-dimensional objects. And in general, mapping brightness and saturation to actual quantitative values
is more error prone than hue maps. So if this is a direct hue map,
then it's easier for us to make a reference into a legend for
what those values are. And this overcomes the problem hue
would ordinarily have as a quantitative variable representation, because we
have this legend here on the side. So here's some examples. Two dimensions and three dimensions,
and we seen the rainbow map is not a very good choice for three dimensional
data because of its light and dark values. But, in two dimensions it does a pretty
good job of showing positive and negative values in this region. A light to dark map is good for
showing magnitude, not necessarily positive or
negative here, but just magnitude here. And it's really a poor choice, you don't want to use luminance mapping
to map variables that are plotted on a three-dimensional surface because it
really interferes with the lighting. So for a three dimensional surface,
you want to try to pick some hue scale that doesn't affect saturation or
value of the color, so that the shading isn't affected by the mapping of the
variable that is plotted over the surface. And so in these two cases we have
uniform brightness, uniform value and saturation, well, at least uniform
value across the colormap, and so it doesn't interfere with
the lighting of a three-dimensional shape. Although, these aren't necessarily the
best colormaps to use for two dimensions where you can get away with
more of a change in luminance. And there's a really good website for
choosing colors called, colorbrewer2.org, and I'd encourage all
of you to take a look at that website. It's designed for picking color maps for
geographical data. And I'll point you to it here and encourage you to go take
a look at it right now. So we've learned that it's
best to think of color for data visualization as being a hue,
a saturation, and a value. And we don't always want to
choose a rainbow colormap when we're displaying our data. We want to look at what kind
of data we're displaying and choose the best colormap for that data. [MUSIC]
