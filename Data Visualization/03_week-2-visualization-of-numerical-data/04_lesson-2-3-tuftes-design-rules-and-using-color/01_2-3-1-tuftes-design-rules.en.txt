[MUSIC] So some of the rules of visual design
can help take a data visualization and make it more appealing so
that people will want to look at it and investigate it more. We don't have time to go into
all the rules of visual design, but I can basically summarize a few of the
rules that have come from Edward Tufte, who's written several
books on the subject. The first one is to let the data speak. It's very easy when we're collecting
data and doing our data processing. To smooth our data,
to try to remove outliers and try to fill in missing data gaps and
so on. Sometimes it's best just to display
the data and let human reasoning, the reasoning of our cognitive systems
be able to take care of those details. For example, here's life expectancy data
for two countries, Belize and Bermuda. Belize has data for
all the years from 1960 to 2012 and Bermuda is missing a lot of data. It's got a lot of gaps
here until the year 2000. And so I could have filled this in with plausible data or
drawn lines between these. But it's better to just let your
inductive system fill these in with what you would expect to be
between these data points. And also to let your abductive reasoning
try to figure out why the data wasn't being gathered in these gaps. Another design rule is that
a picture's worth a thousand words. So you can often show with a diagram or a picture things that it would
take a lot of text to describe. This is a very old illustration. It's a visualization by Charles Minard
in 1869 of Napoleon's army as it's marching towards Moscow. And the width of this line
is the size of the army. And it gets to Moscow, and it's withered down to a small size
compared to what it started with. And then it begins a retreat. The size of the army becomes even smaller, in part because of the falling
temperatures which are plotted down here. It may take a lot of text or annotation in
order to describe what the army size was. But you can see visually here,
based on this pictorially, what's going on a lot better and
in a smaller space. With that said, even though you
can say a lot with pictures, you still need to say a lot with words. Most importantly you should
not forget to label your axes. It's very important to label your axes. Here's a couple diagrams from some of my
own publications where we're plotting various data or various behaviors. You can see there's a lot of attention
that needs to go into annotations to not only make sure that the reader
understands what's being plotted, but also understands
the semantics behind the graph. What bars at this altitude
versus this altitude mean? What this line means here
versus this line here? So annotation words are still
important to visualization and it's the relationship
between the words and the geometry often that gets
the job done in a visualization. You can also add too much
information to a visualization. Tufte's advice is encapsulated
nicely in the term chart junk. Which basically says that when you try to
make a visualization look prettier and add a lot of elements to a visualization,
those elements can detract from the actual message that the visualization
is trying to provide to the observer. Very commonly three dimensions can make a
two-dimensional graph look more engaging. This three-dimensional graph looks
nicer than this two dimensional graph. But as we've seen with perspective,
if I've got a bar that's farther away, if I have a bar in the forefront and
a bar in the background, sometimes it can be difficult to see if
a bar in the background is shorter because it's farther away or is it shorter because
it's representing a smaller amount? So it's better to avoid three dimensions. And it's better to avoid adding a lot
of extraneous details to a chart that may make it look more engaging but
could detract from its real message. A nice quantitative measure of
chart junk is the data-ink ratio. The data-ink ratio basically states that how much data are you displaying
in your visualization divided by how much ink are you
using in the visualization. So, you want to maximize
the data-ink ratio. Meaning, you want to display as much
data as possible using as little ink as possible. So for example, here's a perfectly
good bar chart displaying some item in units of one, two, three,
four, and five unit gaps there. I can display the exact same thing
without these horizontal lines, without even the annotations here on the
left, because the annotations are changing by counting numbers one,
two, three, four, and five. I can just display them as
stacked discreet bar segments and I can see the same information that this is basically some value
a little more than four. This is some value a bit larger than two. I can see the same information here, I've used less ink and
I can focus more on the actual data. This is an example where Ed Tufte
reveals that he's really a minimalist. He wants as little decoration
as possible in visualizations. There are other people working
in visualization who have set up different design aesthetics that have
also generated effective visualizations. So Tufte is not the only name in
visualization and the only advice you should follow, but these are good
recommendations in any case. Another principle is the micro and
the macro of a visualization. So you've got micro level details and
macro level details. The best example is, again, from the NCSA,
here's another visualization of a tornado. On the bottom here we've got
wind being displayed, perhaps, as little stalks of wheat. You can see wind direction
here in the foreground and in the background that
becomes more of a texture. So you've got micro-level and
macro-level details. We can create zoomable interfaces. Zoomable interfaces allow us to change which details are at the macro
level that we can look at, and which details are at the micro level
which we can get a broad overview of. This leads to this mantra for doing large data visualization, where you
want to see a broad overview first, and then get the details on demand, and
be able to zoom into those details, and be able to switch from
a macro view to a micro view. It's also to think of information as
being organized into layers. This is a visualization project that I was
a part of a few years ago, where we were visualizing the structure of music in a
different layout than is usual for music. So we're visualizing, for example,
note values here in blue and we're visualizing similar chord
structures in black characters. And I'm showing some relationships in
light grey of neighboring elements to a given relationship organized
in heavy black here. So by using these different design
elements, changing the color, changing typeface, italics or bold, you can organize the visual display
of information a little bit better, give hints to the viewer of
the different categories. This is very similar to the display
of nominal data using hue, for example, or
using a different type face, or a different decoration as a way of
discriminating between nominal variable. Also multiples, Tufte speaks of multiples. That is to basically maintain
a consistent design and have multiple visualizations using
that same consistent design so that you can see the differences
as the data changes. So in this example from one of my own
papers we have several different graphs. In each case, I've tried to maintain
the exact same the same vertical axis. The same annotation for
the different cases. And, in fact, as much as possible,
the same horizontal axis, although it changes a little bit, so that you can
see the difference from graph to graph in addition to the individual changes in
the data variables inside each graph. Visualizations, especially presentation visualization and
interactive storytelling, tell a story. So you might think, what sort of story is
your data visualization actually telling? The best way to think of this is,
what's happening over time? What's happening across space? Here is a plot of life
expectancy in Rwanda and the neighboring Republic of Congo. And you see this huge dip in
the life expectancy in Rwanda. This is just tragic and
a lot's going on here. These two lines are telling quite
a story because they're describing two neighboring countries and very different
circumstances in the two countries. And finally, color. Your choice of color can be
important if it's used properly, but color chosen arbitrarily
can be quite harmful. In this example, rainbow is not the best. As we'll see next, the choice of
color could be very important and there's additional design decisions to
be made based on the choice of color. Here we're looking at
a three-dimensional object and we're using a rainbow map that
has bright and dark spots in it. Those bright and dark spots can interfere with our
perception of the three-dimensional shape. Also the shading of the three-dimensional
shape can interfere with our perception of the variable
that's being mapped to color. So these rules came from Tufte's books. Tufte tends to be a minimalist. He tends to want to use the least amount of presentation possible
in a visualization. And that's one design criterion. But it's only one of
many design criterions. I encourage you to look at other
visualizations from other designers and to maybe explore your own
sense of design style. [MUSIC]
