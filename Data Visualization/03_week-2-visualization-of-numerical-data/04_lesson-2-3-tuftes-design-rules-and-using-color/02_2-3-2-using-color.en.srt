[SOUND]

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,340
So we often use color
in data visualization.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,153
And it's important to understand how
best to use color to trigger perceptual

4
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:21,650
cues and other ways of sensing the data.

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,390
These rules have come from Colin Ware's
book on information visualization.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,620
As we're picking out colors, it's often
better to think of colors not in their

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,420
component values that are used to store
them in the computer, basically red,

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,880
green, and blue, or
a certain portion of red, green, and blue.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,470
It's better to think of them in a more
natural set of three components.

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,800
Basically hue, saturation, and value.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,180
Hue is basically where the color
is in the color wheel.

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,429
Is it red, yellow, green, cyan, blue,
or magenta, or some place in between.

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,670
Saturation is how intense a color is,

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,270
what is its distance from a dull grey
to a vibrant version of that hue.

15
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,310
And then value is how bright the color is,
its distance from black.

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,240
And so if you're given a color in RGB,
there's a little bit of

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,260
code here that would show you
what the color should be in HSV.

18
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,145
And a similar color space is used any time
you're picking colors in applications.

19
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:30,765
For example, in Microsoft applications
you get this color space,

20
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:35,695
where hue is shown horizontally

21
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:40,365
as we go from red to yellow,
to green, to cyan, to blue,

22
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:45,700
to magenta, and back to red, and
then saturation is vertically.

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,490
And we're moving from a gray
through some muted versions of

24
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,600
the hues all the way to the full
intensity versions of the hues here.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,160
And so you're picking your hue and
your saturation here in this space.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,060
And then value is kind of denoted here,

27
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,600
going from black to full intensity,
and in this case it's going to white.

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,330
This isn't quite a value axis,
but it's very closely related.

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,310
So, hues as we've seen before,
hues are a good choice for

30
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,540
representing nominal variables,
for representing categories.

31
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,500
And we've seen that five or ten hues
are quite effective in visualizations.

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,050
You don't want to have too many colors.

33
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,611
But five to ten different hues can
be quite effective at denoting,

34
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:37,760
at mapping different values
of a nominal variable.

35
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,070
There's as many as twelve colors,
twelve good colors that you can pick from

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,960
that are based on Ward's extension
of some work by Berlin and Kay.

37
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,190
And so, there's the main six colors,
white, black, red, yellow,

38
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,908
green, and blue.

39
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:59,640
And these are uniformly
chosen across cultures

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,350
as being good different colors,
basic colors.

41
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,780
To that you can add six more colors.

42
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,070
Grey, pink, orange,
brown, purple, and cyan.

43
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,870
And so this is a good choice, starting
with the first six and then picking colors

44
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,970
from the next six, if you need good
colors to map to a nominal variable.

45
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:26,208
Saturation is helpful when you're mapping
various elements of a visualization.

46
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:31,510
You want to use fully saturated colors for
small things in a visualization,

47
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,730
if you have a thin line,
you want to use a fully saturated color.

48
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,759
It's easier to see this saturated
red-orange and a saturated blue than

49
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,690
a desaturated red-orange and
a desaturated blue on these two lines.

50
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,880
Both, with a white background,
or a black background,

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,340
it's still easier to see the saturated
lines than the desaturated lines.

52
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,540
You want to use desaturated colors for
fills, so you want saturated strokes and

53
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,220
desaturated fills.

54
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,990
And so here's bar graph with blue and
orange using desaturated blue and

55
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,090
orange, you can still see the differences.

56
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,290
When you have saturated large fills,
the aesthetic can be a bit harsh and

57
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,550
also it could be a little bit distracting.

58
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:22,650
So it's better to have desaturated
fills and saturated strokes.

59
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,960
It's also important to pay
attention to contrast.

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,630
You want to use brighter colors
in order to gain attention.

61
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,310
So here, for example I've got desaturated
bars, and I've got one saturated bar

62
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,410
in case I want to draw attention to this
particular data value in a visualization.

63
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,910
And then you want to pay
attention to brightness contrast,

64
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,290
not just color contrast.

65
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,950
So, contrast means a difference.

66
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,580
Ordinarily contrast deals
with luminance or brightness.

67
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,720
And you look at the brightness of one
color versus the brightness of another

68
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,300
color, or

69
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,950
the value of one color versus
the value of another color.

70
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,590
But you also want to make sure
there's good luminance contrast.

71
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,580
Color contrast is often just
a difference in hue, but

72
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,990
not necessarily
a difference in brightness.

73
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:29,060
Here I've got orange text
on top of a blue hue,

74
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,980
and I'm just changing the saturation and

75
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,650
value of this blue hue from black
to full intensity to white.

76
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,250
And you can see that even though
there's sufficient color contrast,

77
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,690
there's differences in the color, there's
not much difference in the brightness here

78
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,320
and it becomes very difficult to read.

79
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,890
And so you want to make sure you
maintain good brightness contrast,

80
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,330
value contrast,
in addition to just color contrast.

81
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,780
So the recommended usage,
you don't want to use colors

82
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,110
to represent quantitative
variables when you want to

83
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:11,179
measure the difference between
neighboring values in a visualization.

84
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,860
It is a good indication, we can use
density to represent brightness or

85
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,210
value, and
then we have saturation and hue.

86
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,470
It is good for ordinal variables, so
we can tell that one color is brighter

87
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,130
than another color, we can tell that one
color is different than another color, or

88
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:37,570
closer to, for example,
red, or by different hues,

89
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:42,430
or we can tell that one color is
more intense than another color.

90
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,090
So these are good for

91
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,940
ordinal variables even though we can't
tell how much different they would be.

92
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,927
And for categories,
hue is an excellent choice for categories.

93
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:04,760
Changing the value or the brightness,
or changing the saturation.

94
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,620
How grey a color is versus
how intense is not as good

95
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,660
a differentiator of categories.

96
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,100
So the horizontal axis of a bar graph,

97
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,630
you don't necessarily want the bars
to be going between grayer and

98
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:27,620
brighter, but it is good to have them
be different colors, different hues.

99
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,500
You can use color maps to
represent quantitative values,

100
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,580
and this is a very common thing to do.

101
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,380
We see it in weather maps all the time,
for example,

102
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,110
when we're displaying the temperature
in a geographic region.

103
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:53,570
The choice of colormaps
can be problematic.

104
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,020
And so as we saw before in this
three-dimensional visualization,

105
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,300
we're just using an ordinary
rainbow colormap.

106
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,830
It's darker here, it's a little dark here,
and it's brighter here and here.

107
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,740
And those changes in brightness
in the colors chosen for

108
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,890
the colormap can interfere with
the perception of light and

109
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,940
shadow used to get the orientation
of the surfaces here.

110
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:22,630
And it looks like this blue area is
darker than it should be by the shading.

111
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,340
And it looks like this skull has
a divot here when it actually doesn't.

112
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,195
So it's best to avoid brightness and
saturation variations in a colormap for

113
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:37,660
illuminated three-dimensional objects.

114
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,260
And in general, mapping brightness and

115
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,310
saturation to actual quantitative values
is more error prone than hue maps.

116
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,600
So if this is a direct hue map,
then it's easier for

117
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,290
us to make a reference into a legend for
what those values are.

118
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,820
And this overcomes the problem hue
would ordinarily have as a quantitative

119
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,220
variable representation, because we
have this legend here on the side.

120
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,930
So here's some examples.

121
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,740
Two dimensions and three dimensions,
and we seen the rainbow map is not

122
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,880
a very good choice for three dimensional
data because of its light and dark values.

123
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,300
But, in two dimensions it does a pretty
good job of showing positive and

124
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,980
negative values in this region.

125
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,770
A light to dark map is good for
showing magnitude,

126
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,380
not necessarily positive or
negative here, but just magnitude here.

127
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,590
And it's really a poor choice,

128
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,530
you don't want to use luminance mapping
to map variables that are plotted on

129
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,810
a three-dimensional surface because it
really interferes with the lighting.

130
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:50,120
So for a three dimensional surface,
you want to try to pick some hue scale

131
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,020
that doesn't affect saturation or
value of the color, so that the shading

132
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,960
isn't affected by the mapping of the
variable that is plotted over the surface.

133
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:09,620
And so in these two cases we have
uniform brightness, uniform value and

134
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:16,710
saturation, well, at least uniform
value across the colormap,

135
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,490
and so it doesn't interfere with
the lighting of a three-dimensional shape.

136
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,580
Although, these aren't necessarily the
best colormaps to use for two dimensions

137
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,050
where you can get away with
more of a change in luminance.

138
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,805
And there's a really good website for
choosing colors called,

139
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:42,530
colorbrewer2.org, and I'd encourage all
of you to take a look at that website.

140
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:48,860
It's designed for picking color maps for
geographical data.

141
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,600
And I'll point you to it here and

142
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,360
encourage you to go take
a look at it right now.

143
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,020
So we've learned that it's
best to think of color for

144
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,280
data visualization as being a hue,
a saturation, and a value.

145
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,630
And we don't always want to
choose a rainbow colormap

146
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,310
when we're displaying our data.

147
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,368
We want to look at what kind
of data we're displaying and

148
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,630
choose the best colormap for that data.
