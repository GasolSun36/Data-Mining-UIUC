1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:07,680
[SOUND]
So

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,001
often we want to visualize
multiple variables simultaneously.

3
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:16,798
And so we generate stacked graphs
that can display several variables

4
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:19,370
changing along the same dimension.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,030
For a bar chart, we may want to look
at more than just a single quantitative

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,670
dependent variable measured across
an independent variable dimension.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,820
One way of doing this is
with a stacked bar chart.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,780
In this case we can have two or
more dependent variables plotted.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,090
In this case, the blue bars are
representing one dependent variable and

10
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,830
the red bars are representing
a second dependent variable.

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,440
And so we're using q to represent
different nominal value, basically

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,740
the second dependent variable is different
than the first dependent variable.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,020
And then the total amount of
the contribution of both variables

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,270
is represented by the height of
the top of these stacked bars.

15
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,520
And the relative proportion
is being represented by

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,770
the proportion of the bar being
one color versus another color.

17
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,850
And if we want to emphasize
that relative proportion.

18
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,950
We can have the bars stacked to 100% and

19
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,940
just plot the percentage of
the contribution of one variable versus

20
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,083
the other variable as the difference
in the colors of the bars.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,664
This kind of relative contribution is
also represented in a pie chart but

22
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:46,640
in a pie chart you're representing
the contribution based on angle and

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,320
a little bit by area than on position and
length.

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,090
Here in a pie chart the relative
proportion of the blue category

25
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,140
versus the orange category versus the
green category versus the yellow category

26
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,940
is being represented by the angle
as the angle's sum to 360 degrees.

27
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,450
It's also proportional to the area
represented by each of these four regions.

28
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,590
That indication can be degraded
somewhat if you try to

29
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,200
show a pie chart in three dimensions.

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,270
And that's because in three
dimensions we are still perceiving

31
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,970
a three dimensional scene
as a two dimensional image.

32
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,160
And the visual cues we're using include
foreshortening and perspective.

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,790
And those cues can get in the way of our
ability to perceive a region, say in

34
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,220
the foreground, as being larger or smaller
than a region in the background because of

35
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,260
our expectation that perspective is going
to make regions in the foreground larger.

36
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,180
Or at least appear larger and
regions in the background appear smaller,

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,110
even if it's just a orthographic
non-perspective projection.

38
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,410
So, it's best not to use three
dimensions for pie charts and, in fact,

39
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,610
it's better just to use a stacked
bar chart instead of a pie chart.

40
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,130
In this case, each one of these bars
can represent a separate pie chart

41
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,980
because it's representing the separate
relative contribution to the whole of

42
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,170
multiple dependent variables, as they
vary across some independent variable.

43
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,920
Also, stacking order matters.

44
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,600
I've got the same data plotted
in the left and in the right.

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,470
In the left,
I've plotted the blue variable first.

46
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,430
And then I've stacked the red
variable on top of that.

47
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,180
On the right side,
I've plugged the red variable first and

48
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,120
I've stacked the blue
variable on top of that.

49
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,690
On the right it's easy to see that
the red variable isn't changing

50
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,400
across the horizontal axis.

51
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:50,275
On the left, you can still see that
the red variable isn't changing, but

52
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:53,085
you have to see that because
the lengths aren't changing.

53
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:56,975
Whereas on the right,
the actual positions aren't changing.

54
00:03:56,975 --> 00:04:02,245
Which further verifies that position is
a stronger indicator than the length of

55
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:07,125
the actual data values in terms
of mapping two geometric and

56
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,435
spacial display elements.

57
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,600
You can avoid that stacking order problem
by using diverging stacked bar charts if

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,870
you have the red variable creating
bars growing upwards, and

59
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,300
the blue variable creating
bars growing downward.

60
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,810
But that stops working when you
have three or more variables.

61
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,720
Another way to avoid having one variable
dominate the other in stacking order

62
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,690
is to stack them and then re-center
the bar across the horizontal axis.

63
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,970
So instead of growing up
from the horizontal axis

64
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,990
the bar is just centered
at the horizontal axis.

65
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,350
And this give us the same
displacement on the top and

66
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,350
the bottom of the bar chart,
but it helps us to pay more

67
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,580
attention to the areas of the elements
instead of their actual position.

68
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,420
It's much better if you have continuously
changing horizontal and vertical

69
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,960
axis variables to use stacked line graphs,
then stacked bar charts.

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,813
If we can connect their data values
by lines instead of having them

71
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:30,580
discrete bars, then it's easier
to see when areas are changing

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,083
versus areas are remaining
constant as they move across even

73
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:39,877
though they're displaced by
the variance of other variables.

74
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:51,825
