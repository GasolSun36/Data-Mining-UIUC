2
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:11,782
So, in a bar chart for example, we can
use glyphs to represent more than just

3
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:18,170
the actual value of data elements, we can
use glyphs to represent their variants.

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,880
So in this case if we have bars,
we can put a glyph at the top of each bar

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,340
indicating the value, but
we can also add information, for

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,985
example, standard deviation or variants.

7
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:37,045
And, in fact, where the mean or
median value is indicated and

8
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:43,595
where the data varies, so
these could be 25%, 75% bars.

9
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:48,082
And we can see in some cases that
the distribution of data that gets

10
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:51,185
aggregated and
represented as a single bar,

11
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:55,612
the actual distribution is skewed
in one direction or another.

12
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:03,265
In tables, you can use glyphs,
you can represent entries as, for

13
00:01:03,265 --> 00:01:08,460
example, colors, and that's a kind
of a glyph, a very simple glyph.

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,990
But mapping table values to color
is a very common thing, and

15
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:21,520
we're all used to this and seeing weather
maps where heat is mapped to color,

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,720
as for example, this example here.

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,340
Quantitatively mapping
color is not necessarily

18
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,660
the most effective way for
perceptual accuracy.

19
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,640
We can tell that it's colder up here and
warmer down here,

20
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,690
we just might not be able to tell how much
colder or how much warmer it is unless

21
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,640
we go to the reference here, and
try to make an equivalence on this

22
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,800
legend here showing what the average
temperature is for this particular month.

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,450
And you can do this discretely as well.

24
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,660
This is an example of
continuous variables.

25
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,370
You can do this discretely, and we do
this in computer science all the time.

26
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:11,980
If I have a program that I'm trying to
optimize, I might change one parameter

27
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,540
some discrete number of times,
and some other parameter some

28
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,520
discrete number of times, and try to find
the sweet spot in terms of performance.

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,040
The lowest performance here
I'm displaying in red,

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,650
233 is the optimal value here,

31
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,720
and I can see which parameter of
values are giving me worse results.

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,080
And these things may
jump around quite a bit.

33
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,030
Programs tend to behave non-linearly
as you change these parameters

34
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,590
because the systems they run
on are quite complicated.

35
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,290
But having these glyphs, basically these
numbers represented as color as well,

36
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,870
helps you hone in on the good values.

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,870
And this one was enabled
just using Microsoft Excel.

38
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,030
The conditional formatting
option allows you to

39
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,330
represent values with color as well.

40
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,650
So you can also use glyphs to do
high dimensional visualization.

41
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,640
So in this case this is
worlds within worlds,

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,880
I've set up horizontal and
vertical nominal,

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,030
categorical axes and
when I'm plotting inside

44
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,110
each of these table cells,
is a separate plot, it's a scatter plot.

45
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,850
I just happen to have one data
point in the scatter plot, so

46
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,310
I've embedded a two dimensional plot in
each element of a two dimensional table.

47
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,350
So that enables you to look
at four dimensional data

48
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,385
as basically a two dimensional
table of two-dimensional plots.

49
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:46,255
In this case what I'm doing is I've
got a two-dimensional table of glyphs.

50
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:49,575
Each glyph happens to be
a two-dimensional plot.

51
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:53,714
And so I'm looking in this
case at life expectancy, and

52
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:59,529
I'm looking at the rates of infant
mortality inside each year from 2000,

53
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:03,073
2001, 2002, 2003, 2004.

54
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:07,764
And then vertically I'm looking at
the various continents or regions, and

55
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:12,176
I'm looking at the life expectancy
measured inside each one of those.

56
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:16,956
So I've got an outer table
that's looking at the year and

57
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:21,239
vertically looking at
the region of the world, and

58
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,521
then inside each year and
each region of the world,

59
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:30,920
I'm plotting infant mortality
versus life expectancy.

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,280
You can see some shifts in the data as we
move across different areas of the world.

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,700
And you can see some shifts
in infant mortality, but

62
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,260
you can see that there aren't as many
shifts as you move from year to year.

63
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,520
There's another interesting glyph that
you can use called Chernoff faces, and

64
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,050
in this case you're creating a table,
some other layout, but

65
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,560
the data points are being plotted with
faces, and the attributes of the face

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,060
are indicating various measures of
some dimension of the data set.

67
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,150
In this case this is 12 state judges as

68
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,500
rated by lawyers and you can map
certain features, certain aspects,

69
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,530
of the way the state judges were being
measured, for example, the number of

70
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,750
times they were overturned, might change
the expression from happy to sad.

71
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,230
And the size of the face may be
the number of cases they've seen.

72
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,760
So, you know, this face may look
quite large, and this face look

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,632
quite small because this state judge has
reviewed more cases than has this judge.

74
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:47,070
And so you can't make value judgments
based on the appearance of the faces, but

75
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,580
the appearance of the faces and
the expressions that they

76
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,200
have can give you another data channel
that you can perceive and remember,

77
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,340
actually quite well as a way of finding
interesting aspects of the data,

78
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,740
things in the data that stand out.

79
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,028
So we learned that we can use glyphs
to display many other attributes

80
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:15,615
of our data when we're using a chart or
some other data visualization.

81
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:25,615
