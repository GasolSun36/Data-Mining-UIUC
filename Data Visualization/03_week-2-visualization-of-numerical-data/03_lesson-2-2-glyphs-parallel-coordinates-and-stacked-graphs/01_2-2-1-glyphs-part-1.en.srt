1
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:12,064
So when we visualize data,
we're plotting the data.

2
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:16,198
And then we need to figure out what we're
going to use to represent each piece

3
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:17,520
of data.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,320
That piece of data we're
going to call a glyph

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,520
when it's represented visually
as part of a data visualization.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,280
So as we saw before, charts display data,
and the choice of chart and the elements

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,270
of a chart are often dependent on the
kinds of data that we want to indicate.

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,440
We can use glyphs in charts to further
display data, either new data or

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,290
to reinforce existing data.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,610
For example, the shapes at the top of
a bar chart, or the actual shapes of

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,840
the bars in a bar chart or a Gantt
chart can change based on the data.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,070
In this case, the thickness of the bars
can change based on the data value.

13
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,190
If we're plotting a line chart or
a scatter chart,

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,720
we can use different values for the data
points, different glyphs to represent

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,480
different values of the data points of yet
a third variable.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,460
Tables, as you're plotting two nominal
values here, two categories, and

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,460
looking at the intersection of those
two categories we can plot yet

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,940
a third variable based on the shape or
other decorations of the values.

19
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:31,660
So glyphs are items that indicate data
points in a chart or a data visualization,

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,610
and they have other dimensions that
they can use to encode other measures.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,440
So for example,
here is a simulation of a tornado

22
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,390
that's part of a presentation
visualization at the NCSA.

23
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,790
And on the ground we have an array,
basically a grid of cones laid out.

24
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,877
And these cones are glyphs
that are indicating

25
00:01:55,877 --> 00:01:59,750
the ground wind speed and direction.

26
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,940
And so speed is being mapped
to the length of the cone, and

27
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,420
length is a good perceptual
indicator of a quantitative value.

28
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,990
And then we have the direction, the wind
direction is the orientation of the cone.

29
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:20,230
And ordinarily, we wouldn't care about any
one direction being greater than another,

30
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,860
but we're using the differences in wind
direction from one cone to another

31
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,119
in order to indicate convergence or
divergence of the wind.

32
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,600
And so, we're using perspective here.

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,580
So we can see some of the details
of the cones here in the forefront,

34
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,570
and then we can see some
textures in the background.

35
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,970
And then you can see some
color changes in these glyphs.

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,610
These cones are being coded in color.

37
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,660
If they're orange,
it represents an updraft, and

38
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,780
if they're in blue, then it's a downdraft.

39
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,280
And so we're using color to emphasize

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,330
a directional change in a particularly
important direction of up or down.

41
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,420
And so these glyphs give us
the opportunity to encode additional

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,164
data variables in what would ordinarily
be just a two dimensional chart

43
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:13,197
here on the ground of this
three-dimensional visualization.

44
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,480
So in terms of our analysis
of perceptual effectiveness,

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,740
we're mapping quantitative values.

46
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,620
For example, wind speed and
wind direction as length and angle.

47
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,320
And direction as a quantitative value,

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,900
because we're looking at the differences
between neighboring points quantitatively.

49
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,050
We have some nominal
values that we're mapping.

50
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,810
For example, updrafts or
downdrafts are being mapped as hue.

51
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,280
We're not saying that one
is greater than the other,

52
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,810
just that they're different categories,

53
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,810
fundamental categories of wind direction,
whether the wind is going up or down.

54
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,970
And we're mapping that to hue,

55
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,389
which is a very effective use of
a mapping value to a data value.

56
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,070
And then finally, the shape is nominal in
the fact that if I go back to the original

57
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:03,050
slide, the actual particles are being
mapped with spheres and cylinders.

58
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,320
Whereas, the wind speed on the ground
is being mapped with a cone.

59
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,100
And so that shape difference Is another
nominal indication that you're looking at

60
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,880
data from ground wind speed versus
airborne wind speeds from the particles.

61
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,346
So you can map other data too.

62
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:30,126
