1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,845
[SOUND]
So

2
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,973
we're used to seeing
two-dimensional images, and

3
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:15,907
we can use two-dimensional images to
perceive our three-dimensional world, and

4
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:18,825
we perceive time as maybe
a fourth dimension, but

5
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:24,180
then our ability to perceive dimensions is
limited to those three or four dimensions.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,540
Parallel coordinates offer us a way
of plotting even higher dimensional

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,479
spaces than that.

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,470
So in looking at the higher
dimensional drawings or

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,880
higher dimensional spaces,
you can think of something like a square.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,190
A square consists of two
one-dimensional lines,

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,980
these two vertical lines,
that are separated horizontally.

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,820
I've taken a one dimensional line,
copied into a second vertical line and

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,340
then connected them up with
lines between the vertices.

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,330
So I've now got a two-dimensional square.

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,910
If I want to make this two-dimensional
square into a three-dimensional cube,

16
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,150
I just copy the square, and move it in
a direction, and then I just link up

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,560
the corresponding vertices with lines, and
that gives me a three-dimensional cube.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,430
If I want a four-dimensional cube,
I just take the three-dimensional cube and

19
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,330
I make another copy of it and
offset it in another direction, and

20
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,620
then just draw lines between
the corresponding vertices and it gives me

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,630
a tesseract, some two-dimensional
projection of a four-dimensional cube.

22
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,350
And so you can do this, but
it's not very helpful for

23
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,970
visualization, because you've got all
these different directions that are being

24
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,340
projected into a two-dimensional image,
and after three dimensions, we're just

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,080
not used to perceiving the world in four
or higher dimensions, and so we just have

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,550
difficulty perceiving four-dimensional or
higher data being projected that way.

27
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:56,250
If I have a scatter plot, for example,
I can pretty readily see x and

28
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,790
y encoded in the positional Cartesian
coordinates of x and y here.

29
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,160
If I had a z coordinate
that's being projected,

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,700
z is being foreshortened as
it's being projected here, and

31
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,050
I've gotta mentally remember that z
is some combination of horizontal and

32
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,440
vertical that's different than
the horizontal x or the vertical y axis.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,670
So you can draw these hints that
are basically similar to a shadow,

34
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,300
where I'm indicating,
with these dashed lines,

35
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,540
what the coordinates of this green
dot are in three dimensions,

36
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,600
because it lacks other visual cues
of where it is in three dimensions.

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,863
If you try to do this in four dimensions,

38
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:40,267
then it becomes a nightmare to
manage all those dimensions.

39
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:44,789
So there's a better technique for doing
this called parallel coordinates that

40
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,028
Al Inselberg demonstrated to
me back in the early 90s,

41
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:52,817
when they were first invented, and I was
quite blown away by his demonstration, and

42
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:54,660
I'll try to reproduce it here.

43
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,250
So on parallel coordinates, we're
going to take the Cartesian coordinates.

44
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,150
We have a horizontal x-axis and
a vertical y-axis, and

45
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,610
we're going to take these axes and
we're going to

46
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,430
make them parallel instead of orthogonal,
at right angles, as they usually are.

47
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,594
So I'm going to take the x-axis,
I'm going to put it here, and

48
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:18,520
I'm going to take the y-axis and
I'm going to put it here.

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,142
And so I'll label this axis x and
this axis y.

50
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:26,229
So now the two axes are not orthogonal.

51
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:30,550
They're parallel to each other and
they don't extend from the same origin.

52
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,550
So the origin here is
horizontally at the bottom and

53
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,540
increasing x goes up this axis,
increasing y goes up this axis.

54
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,400
So now I've got the data points, and I
need to figure out where these data points

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,100
occur, so if I take the y-coordinates
of each data point,

56
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,970
I can map each point onto its
corresponding position on the y-axis.

57
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,680
I'm just basically dragging them across
horizontally, because their position in y

58
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,089
in this chart corresponds to
their height along this y-axis.

59
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:05,628
If I want to do the same for

60
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:10,580
the x-axis, I'm going to basically take
the x position of each point, and then I'm

61
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,490
going to drag it to the corresponding
x position on this vertical x-axis, so

62
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,540
the horizontal length here corresponds
to the vertical length here, and

63
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,060
so blue and red are at the same
horizontal x coordinate, and so

64
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,460
they overlap each other on the x-axis.

65
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,730
And in green is a little bit
farther to the right, so

66
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,020
it's going to be a little bit
higher on the parallel x-axis.

67
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,790
Yellow is a little bit
farther to the right so

68
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,530
it's going to be a little bit higher.

69
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,130
And then this blue green color
dot is the farthest right so

70
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,900
it'll be the highest on the x-axis.

71
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,779
So now I've got this one set of
points that's now appearing as two

72
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:55,570
sets of points, and
I've got a correspondence between color,

73
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,006
and color's a good perceptual
indicator of category, but

74
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:04,290
it's very difficult to
perceive what's going on here.

75
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,145
So what we're going to do is, instead of
displaying these as points on the axis,

76
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:13,676
I'm going to connect these
points with lines, and

77
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:16,862
I'm going to delete the original points,
and

78
00:05:16,862 --> 00:05:21,942
now we get this nice duality between
points in the coordinate system,

79
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:25,672
here, and
lines in the coordinate system, here.

80
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:31,420
So, this orange point, here,
has an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate.

81
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:37,640
It corresponds to this line connecting
its x-coordinate to its y-coordinate.

82
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,700
And so each one of these five points
in the Cartesian x y coordinate

83
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,730
system corresponds to a line in
the parallel x y coordinate system here.

84
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,310
Some other features are collinearity,
so if these three points lie along

85
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:00,000
the same line, then you get this nice
convergence in parallel coordinates.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,960
And so you can see some co-linearity
that happens, because lines in parallel

87
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,760
coordinates, corresponding to points in
Cartesian coordinates that are collinear,

88
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,140
will basically converge in a point
in the parallel coordinate system.

89
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,990
So you can add extra dimensions.

90
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,289
If I add a z-axis here, I'd have to add
all sorts of three-dimensional queues to

91
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:23,720
these data points to figure out
where they are in three dimensions.

92
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,910
In parallel coordinates,
I just add a z-axis here.

93
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,606
And then I can connect
the z-coordinates to the y-coordinates,

94
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:36,740
and follow this line from its x-coordinate
to its y-coordinate to its z-coordinate.

95
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,630
And if I add a fourth w-axis.

96
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,610
It's actually easy to
add a fourth axis here.

97
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,155
And in fact, all of these points may be
collinear in the z w coordinate system,

98
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:52,480
and you can see because these lines
are kind of converging to the same point.

99
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,900
The point that they converge to doesn't
necessarily have to be between the axes.

100
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,240
But there are some ways of helping
a person to see these points.

101
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,750
And so these parallel coordinates are
really useful for high-dimensional data.

102
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,627
And you get this correspondence of being
able to follow these lines through

103
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:15,940
the various coordinates and
have them correspond to points here, and

104
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,710
it's easier to see some relationships.

105
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,410
There could be correspondences
between the w-axis and the y-axis, and

106
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,653
we wouldn't see those unless we
also had lines from these points on

107
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:32,651
the w-axis to the points on the y-axis,
and so you get a bit of a combinatorial

108
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:37,220
nightmare when you try to connect
every axis to every other axis.

109
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,710
So there's some decision making that
needs to happen if you're going to show

110
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,650
correspondences between axes,

111
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,780
to choose to have those axes next to each
other in the parallel coordinates system.

112
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,530
So parallel coordinates take
the orthogonal axes of the Cartesian

113
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,343
coordinate system and they lay them out in
parallel, and you can have any number of

114
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:02,808
these parallel coordinate axes laid
next to each other, and you can start to

115
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:07,048
perceive higher dimensional data
using these parallel coordinates.

116
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:11,369
Some of the problems of parallel
coordinates are the fact that you're only

117
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:16,172
seeing the pairwise relationship between
the axes, but they can be very useful for

118
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:20,306
finding certain features in your data,
for example, collinearity.

119
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:29,978
