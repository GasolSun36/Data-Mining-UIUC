[SOUND] So, if we create stacked graph layouts, stacked bar charts, and stacked line
graphs of a lot of dependent variables, then you get some interesting
effects as displayed here. You start to see kind of a stream effect,
and you can see the same data variable evolving as it
moves across the horizontal axis. But you also see some other
problems with this representation. One is that the variants
in the lower variables in the stack can influence
the shape of the higher variables. And it can be harder to see when things
get sheared towards the outsides, whether they're representing the variables
the same value or if it's increasing or decreasing. And also you can see that by the time
you get to the very top of the graph, it's changing quite violently because
it's the sum of all the changes that have happened below it. We can analyze this by
using a few variables. If we let each variable at a given
horizontal position on the horizontal axis, each variable be represented by say,
f1 for the first variable, f2 for the second variable And
so on, f1, f2, f3. Then we can define, basically,
ground zero, g0, to be the baseline level. And in this case, we're just setting g0
to be 0, just at the horizontal axis. Then g i is the position of the top
of the plot of the i'th variable. And the top of the plot of the i'th
variable g i is just equal to g0 plus that variable and
all the variables below it in the stack. And we can start to do some analysis. And because of this analysis, there is
an alternative layout called ThemeRiver. And ThemeRiver basically
centered the vertical plot, the stack of variables
along the horizontal axis. Set it set g0 to be one-half of the total
height of the stack of variables. And by doing that, it basically said that
the way this thing is varying at the top will be a mirror image of the way
this thing is varying at the bottom. And you get more of a, the appearance of
a river that data is kind of streaming by and evolving and it reduced the amount
of shearing that was happening, but it didn't eliminate it completely. You can see for example, this region
right here, is creating a large shift in the data around it that
you'd like to be able to minimize. So just by centering the vertical stack
of data around the horizontal axis minimizes the heighth of the chart around that horizontal axis and it also minimizes
the slope at the top and the bottom. There's a Streamgraph layout that
does an even better job of this and it does this just by changing
where the position g0 is. Streamgraph sets g0 equal to
the result of this formula. So you just evaluate this formula
based on your data values f i, and we won't go through
the derivation of this formula. But by just changing where the base
of this stacked bar chart or stacked line chart occurs and
then stacking based to that new baseline, we get an even smoother appearance and
it makes it even easier for us to make comparisons as we move
horizontally across this chart, to determine relative changes to
each of these dependent variables. It minimizes the deviation and
the wiggle, the deviation being how far a variable's plot moves from its previous
position on the horizontal axis, and the wiggle is minimizing the slope,
basically the sheer effect that you get from the wiggle. You can also improve the appearance
by changing the order in which you add variables. So, if variables are zero until a certain
position on the horizontal axis, and then they change
from zero to some value, you can change where they appear
in the stack of variables. And so in this case, they're just
stacked in some fixed ordering, some arbitrary ordering. And you can see kind of
a stream in the coloring. Coloring each variable differently
helps perceive that stream. In this case they're colored
based on when the variable starts to take on a value other than zero. But you can also add new variables when the variables take on
a value other than zero. You can always add them to
the outside of the graph. And what that does,
is it takes variables that start out at a certain point on the horizontal axis,
as soon as they take on the nonzero value, you add them but
you add them to the outside, so their initial surge in value doesn't
disturb the other variables. It's happening on
the outside of the graph. And then as it's waning, other variables are taking non-zero values and
being added to the outside of the graph. And so you get this nice, flowing
appearance where you can see the relative change in values of these variables as
you move right on the horizontal axis, even though we're looking at 10 or
20 variables in a given stack, vertically. So we learned how to make a stream graph,
and how something as simple as
stacking a bar chart can become a point of further investigation in
order to how to display it effectively. We also learned that, for example, a pie chart can become misleading
especially when shown in three dimensions. [MUSIC]
