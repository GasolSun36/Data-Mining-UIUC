  Week 2: Visualization of Numerical Data
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  During this week's module, you will learn how to appropriately select chart time and assign data to chart elements, all while learning how to visualize data in the most effective way possible. You'll also learn how to plot data variables using higher dimensional visualization methods, and apply principles of design and color to make your visualizations compelling, engaging, and effective.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Time

 <p>
  This module should take
  <strong>
   approximately 4-5 hours

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Select an appropriate chart time and assign data to appropriate chart elements to visualize data effectively.
   </p>
  </li>

  Key Phrases and Concepts
 </h2>
 <p>
  Keep your eyes open for the following key terms or phrases as you complete the readings and interact with the lectures. These topics will help you better understand the content in this module.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Data variables: nominal, ordinal, and quantitative; discrete v. continuous; dependent v. independent
   </p>

  <li>
   <p>
    The perceptual accuracy of how different chart elements represent data variables
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How glyphs represent multiple dimensions of individual data items, how parallel coordinates plot data over many dimensions, and how streamgraphs improve on stacked bar charts

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this week, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
