[SOUND] In last week's module we learned
about different visualization systems, how computer graphics is
used to present data, and most importantly
how we observe data and perceive the data based
on how it's presented. In this week's module,
we'll be focusing on the data and different attributes of the data and
how best to incorporate that into a visualization
system for its effective display. Here's an example using Tableau,
which is one of several different visualization systems that are available
to help with visualizing data. We have data on the left. And the is the data from
the World Bank Indicators. And, for example,
we might be interested in life expectancy. And we might also want to see, how does infant mortality affect
the estimate of life expectancy? And then we might want to separate
that by country or region. So Tableau, for example, has this Show Me
button here in the upper right corner. The Show Me button,
you can click that, and based on the data you've selected, Tableau will show you the specific kinds of charts
you may want to use to display that data. We click on one of those, and we
automatically get a visualization of that data, where the, horizontally the columns
are showing infant mortality. Vertically, the rows are showing
us the average life expectancy. So, as we move vertically up,
we're seeing life expectancy. Horizontally, we're
seeing infant mortality. And then each one of these
circles is indicating a different country that we might be looking at. And so, if you use Tableau
you can use this Show Me screen in order to automatically find the
appropriate kinds of visualization methods you would use for that. What I'm going to be talking about
this week and actually in module four in the fourth week of the class
is the background information. The papers that have been
written on the subject that went in to creating this Show Me
button so that we can figure out how this Show Me button automatically laid out
this data in the appropriate manner. So that you can use any tool you
like to set up your visualizations. There's obviously other reasons
you would want to use Tableau, but you'll know enough to be able to do
the same thing that the Show Me button is doing on your own with
any visualization system. [MUSIC]
