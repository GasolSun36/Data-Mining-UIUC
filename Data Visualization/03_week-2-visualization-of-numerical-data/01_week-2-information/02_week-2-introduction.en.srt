00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:06,879
[SOUND] In last week's module we learned
about different visualization systems,

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,863
how computer graphics is
used to present data,

3
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:14,550
and most importantly
how we observe data and

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,656
perceive the data based
on how it's presented.

5
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:22,060
In this week's module,
we'll be focusing on the data and

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,839
different attributes of the data and
how best to

7
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,230
incorporate that into a visualization
system for its effective display.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,090
Here's an example using Tableau,
which is one of several different

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,910
visualization systems that are available
to help with visualizing data.

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,130
We have data on the left.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,670
And the is the data from
the World Bank Indicators.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,930
And, for example,
we might be interested in life expectancy.

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,470
And we might also want to see,

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,620
how does infant mortality affect
the estimate of life expectancy?

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,840
And then we might want to separate
that by country or region.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,990
So Tableau, for example, has this Show Me
button here in the upper right corner.

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,560
The Show Me button,
you can click that, and

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,760
based on the data you've selected, Tableau

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,460
will show you the specific kinds of charts
you may want to use to display that data.

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,740
We click on one of those, and we
automatically get a visualization of that

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:25,570
data, where the, horizontally the columns
are showing infant mortality.

22
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,260
Vertically, the rows are showing
us the average life expectancy.

23
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,690
So, as we move vertically up,
we're seeing life expectancy.

24
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,190
Horizontally, we're
seeing infant mortality.

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,870
And then each one of these
circles is indicating a different

26
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,800
country that we might be looking at.

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,060
And so, if you use Tableau
you can use this Show Me

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,980
screen in order to automatically find the
appropriate kinds of visualization methods

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,290
you would use for that.

30
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,420
What I'm going to be talking about
this week and actually in module four

31
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,530
in the fourth week of the class
is the background information.

32
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,580
The papers that have been
written on the subject

33
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,130
that went in to creating this Show Me
button so that we can figure out how this

34
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,840
Show Me button automatically laid out
this data in the appropriate manner.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,320
So that you can use any tool you
like to set up your visualizations.

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,658
There's obviously other reasons
you would want to use Tableau, but

37
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:32,291
you'll know enough to be able to do
the same thing that the Show Me button is

38
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,461
doing on your own with
any visualization system.

39
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:44,748
