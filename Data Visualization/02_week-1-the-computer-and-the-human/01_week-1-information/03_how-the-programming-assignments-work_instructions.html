   How the Programming Assignments Work
  </strong>
 </h1>
 <p>
  The Data Visualization course includes two programming assignments, one during Week 2 and another during Week 3. These programming assignments give you the opportunity to apply your understanding of data visualization to a visualization project. For Programming Assignment 1 (during Week 2), you will create a visualization of quantitative data (data involving numbers), whereas for Programming Assignment 2 (during Week 3), you will create a visualization of non-quantitative data, such as visualizing a network. Using a programming language is not required to complete either project, but it is allowed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your programming assignments will be peer graded. During Weeks 2 and 3, I will detail what you are to submit and where you are to submit it. The programming assignments that you submit will then be graded by four or more of your peers. At the same time, you will grade programming assignments submitted by four or more of your peers. Your final score for each graded programming assignment will be the median of all the scores your work receives.
 </p>
 <p>
  You are required to grade fairly. While we do not manually review every score that is given to a peer, we do scan for trends within the data that suggest further investigation when someone is not giving a thoughtful score. Unfair grading is a violation of the Coursera Terms of Service and may constitute dismissal from the class and disqualification from earning a Course Certificate. Peer grading is an important part of the ecosystem that makes a course with this many participants successful. Keep in mind, however, that you are not only helping others when you grade a peer's assignment, but you also benefit from this process. Carefully reviewing a peer's assignment gives you insights into what others are doing and may spark ideas for your own assignments. Furthermore, when you receive feedback from your peers, you will likely gain ideas of how to improve your own assignments.

   Instructions for Week 1
  </strong>
 </h1>
 <p>
  The first week is best spent preparing an environment for you to complete these two projects, and so we have a project milestone to set up your data visualization environment. This project milestone is not graded, but it will be very helpful for you to make progress on your project. Delaying work on your project will result in a lot more work for you in the next modules.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you plan to use computer programming to complete your programming assignments, then you should set up a programming environment that enables you to plot data and display graphics in an image, video, or other medium that can be made available through a webpage URL to others for grading. If you do not plan to use computer programming, then you should select a software/web platform that you will use to construct your data visualization. A good starting point for these software and online web data visualizations is available on the

  You should also consider what data you would like to visualize. Is there anything in particular about which you might be curious and would like to study? Or is there a subject with which you are already familiar but about which you would like to educate your colleagues? This is an opportunity to peruse the many data repositories freely available on the internet, and to use data visualization to learn and educate. The

  I want to encourage you to be as creative as possible with the programming assignments. I've been amazed at the work my students have submitted in my past visualization classes, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
