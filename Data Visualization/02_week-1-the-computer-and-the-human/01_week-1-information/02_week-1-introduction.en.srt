1
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:11,303
So what is data visualization?

2
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:14,200
Well, data is stored on a computer.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,260
But we want to work with the data, and so

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,900
we need to get the data somehow out
of the computer and into our heads.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,240
So we can think about the data.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,780
So we can understand the data.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,410
So we can gain insight into
what the data represents.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,840
And so the best way we've found to do
that is using visual communication.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,810
And so data visualization is a high
bandwidth connection between

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,670
the computer and the human brain that
transmits as efficiently as possible

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,329
the data from the computer and
inserts it into our brains.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,130
And so here's a sample system,
a typical visualization system,

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,380
that I've got diagrammed here.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,640
We have a scanner here that's
going to acquire data.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,280
In this case it's going to use
a laser beam in order to scan.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,340
The shape of this graduate student's head,
and

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,350
then that data gets processed by
the computer into geometry and

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,380
color, and then it gets displayed
on this display screen.

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,840
At this point we set up
this visualization, this

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,200
data visualization channel that's going to
take this data from the display screen.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,780
And inserted it into my brain
through this perceptual channel.

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,840
So, we get this visualization operation
where I'm looking at the data,

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,500
and it's going through
my perceptual system,

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,220
going into my human memory and
then I can start to think about it.

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,860
In this case, there's some strange
things happening with the laser scanning

26
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,580
here at the top of the students head.

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,270
And I want to try to understand
why that's happening.

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,710
And so data visualization
isn't just about seeing data.

29
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,530
It's about understanding data and being
able to make decisions based on the data.

30
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,870
And so another example of how data
visualization has been useful.

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,610
Is when I discovered just
as a university professor.

32
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,780
So, students apply for

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,440
graduate school at Computer Science
at the University of Illinois, and

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,200
we have a webpage that they use to select
faculty they might want to work with.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,030
And so we say, pick out the three
faculty members you'd like to work with,

36
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,940
and then we have drop down
menus with all the faculty.

37
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,660
And students pick the faculty they
want to work with, and then the students

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,090
having made that choice, that
information is entered into a database.

39
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,930
And for each student applicant, we can see
the faculty they might be interested in

40
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,030
working with and
we can start to get an idea for

41
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,131
each faculty member what students
they would want to pick from.

42
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,570
So, I wanted to plot to see how uniform
this was across the faculty, and

43
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,630
so I used a data visualization
tool in order to do this and

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,970
I came up with a standard bar chart.

45
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,280
And, horizontally, these are basically
the different faculty members.

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,570
There's some faculty members are in our
department, and some are affiliated

47
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,890
with our department, and some get more
students interested in working with them,

48
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,420
and some get fewer students
working with them, and so

49
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,910
horizontally I've got the a faculty
members here and vertically I'm plotting

50
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,430
the number of student that want to
work with that faculty member.

51
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,410
And so we've got some faculty
members that are very popular and

52
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,350
some that aren't very popular and again,
some of the one's that aren't very

53
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,630
popular are faculty that
are affiliated with other departments.

54
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,840
And students usually apply to work
with them through other departments.

55
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:43,070
And I've eliminated the faculty names
here, just to avoid any embarrassment.

56
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,980
So we've got this list and
then I colour code it, the bar charts.

57
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,860
This is a stacked bar chart.

58
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,150
I've colour coded the bar
charts based on blue,

59
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,060
if the faculty member was
a students first choice.

60
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,910
Orange if the faculty member was
the students second choice, and

61
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,940
green if the faculty member
was the students third choice.

62
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,720
And you might see something here,

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,070
I certainly saw it when I
first plotted this data, and

64
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:15,800
that was that students were picking
people in the first half of the alphabet.

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,860
This is in alphabetical order.

66
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,350
Students are picking faculty from
the first part of the alphabet first,

67
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,770
and they're picking people from the second
half of the alphabet mostly last.

68
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,620
And then the middle part of the alphabet,
or I should say,

69
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,940
they're picking second people
uniformly across the alphabet and

70
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,910
what I discovered was that
from this visualization,

71
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,520
was that students were picking
faculty in alphabetical order.

72
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,850
And having made that discovery
from that visualization,

73
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,700
I was able to work back
into the system and

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,510
figure out why students were picking
faculty in alphabetical order.

75
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,720
And the reason was we had three pull
down lists with all the faculty.

76
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,610
And so
the students would go down the list and

77
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,520
find the first faculty member they
were interested in and click there.

78
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,990
They'd go down the list and pick the
second faculty they were interested in and

79
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,970
they would select that, and

80
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,520
then they would find the third faculty
member they were interested in and

81
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,720
click that, and then that would go into
the database, but when we were looking

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,450
at the database, in order to evaluate
what students might want to work with us.

83
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:28,310
We were assuming students were picking the
faculty they wanted to work with first,

84
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,980
as the first choice, and
their second choice was second, and

85
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,670
their third choice was third.

86
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,680
When in fact, they were just
finding three faculty members and

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,840
picking them when they
appeared in the list.

88
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,300
And so in this case data visualization
helped us make a decision

89
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,060
that we wouldn't have
been aware of otherwise.

90
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,789
And so that's a hallmark of data
visualization is to provide

91
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,580
insight into the data, and
be able to use that insight in order

92
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,880
to make further decisions,
further hypotheses to explore further.

93
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,120
And so that's the kind of insight
that I want to provide and

94
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,160
the tools that I want to provide,
to students in this course.

95
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,810
And so we'll work through basically four
weeks of materials on data visualization.

96
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,460
The first week, we're just going
to understand the platform for

97
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,910
data visualization.

98
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,200
Basically, how a computer displays data,
and

99
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,786
then how the user perceives and
processes it.

100
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,650
And so we'll spend most of the first
week just studying the computer and

101
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,410
studying the human.

102
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:42,500
The second week, we'll introduce a few
simple charts, bar charts and so on.

103
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,910
And more importantly, we'll look at
the kinds of data that we want to display.

104
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,670
That we want to visualize,
and we'll make sure.

105
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,420
That we're using the proper chart for
the proper kinds of data.

106
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,050
And that the proper kinds of

107
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,340
data are being mapped to
the correct elements of that chart.

108
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,350
And then we'll also talk about how
to design charts effectively to

109
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,208
convey that data.

110
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,996
In week three,
we'll look at how to layout and

111
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:14,060
display other data,
non numerical data, relational data.

112
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,850
When you're data isn't necessarily
going to be a number that

113
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,990
will give you a height and
a bar chart, but

114
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,380
is basically a relation that says
item A is related to item B.

115
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,530
How do we display that?

116
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,720
How do we visualize that?

117
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,760
How do we gain insight
into that kind of data?

118
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,590
So we spend week three on

119
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,860
more looking at abstract data
as opposed to numerical data.

120
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,720
And then week four,
we'll talk about visualizing data bases,

121
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,420
how to visualize
the results of data mining.

122
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,920
And how to analyze the way we work, so

123
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,800
the visualization can provide us the
insight into how do we make a decision.

124
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,460
And so we'll talk about how to make
a visualization dashboard that gives you

125
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,180
the information you need, in order
to make an effective decision, and

126
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,380
an informed decision.

127
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,690
So I think it's useful to talk about what
we won't be able to cover in these four

128
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,590
weeks.

129
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,130
We're going to talk about
abstract data visualization.

130
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:21,280
I'm not going to be able to talk in much
detail about specific tools used for

131
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,540
visualization, or visualization tools for
scientific visualization or

132
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:32,010
medical visualization, business data,
business intelligence systems and so on.

133
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,290
There's a number of tutorials.

134
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,250
And manuals for
using specific packages and

135
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,960
we just won't have time to
go into any one of them, but

136
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,090
i'll try to provide examples across
those different applications.

137
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,770
I'll be able to provide,
provide a few design principles, but

138
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,670
I won't be able to cover a full course
on visual design for presentation and

139
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,740
so there are good courses on that.

140
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,200
That you might take a look at,
but, we'll just be looking at

141
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,790
some very minimal design principles that
are most effective for data visualization.

142
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,960
And this will be an introduction to
the topics of data visualization.

143
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,100
And data visualization can
be a very deep subject.

144
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:25,250
And I won't be able to get into
the details of visualization.

145
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,660
Will be at sort of a high level of
the different areas of visualization.

146
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,500
But focusing on the important
topics of visualization to

147
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,920
make any visualization successful,
and to work well.

148
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,150
I'll try to provide pointers to tools, but
again, not tutorials on how to use those

149
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,860
tools, and
there'll be a couple of assignments in

150
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,300
the course, and programming can be used to
complete those assignments and I encourage

151
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,470
you to program if you know how to do these
assignments, but it's not required and

152
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,350
I'll provide existing tools that you can
use that you don't need to write a program

153
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,260
in order to use to visualize your data in
order to complete these assignments and

154
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,380
in general to be able to visualize data.

155
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,420
And finally, I'd like to

156
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,390
thank a few people that have been very
helpful with putting this course together.

157
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,570
Eric Shaffer is a lecturer here
at the University of Illinois.

158
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,150
And he's talked in one of the most recent
scientific visualization classes we

159
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,650
had and he's provided some materials for
me for this class from that.

160
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,320
I've very grateful for his help on that.

161
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,560
Karrie Karahalios is also a professor of
Computer Science here at the University of

162
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,370
Illinois and
she's taught social visualization classes,

163
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,970
especially visualizing, kind of
relational data in social situations and

164
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,030
she's a world renowned
expert on that area and

165
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,040
has provided me with a lot of
resources and website links for

166
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,520
tools to help with a variety
of visualization methods.

167
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,920
Mike Gleicher is a professor, a friend
of mine at the University of Wisconsin.

168
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,970
We just completed a university wide data
visualization course and had some nice

169
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,970
material there that he provided me that
I've also been able to use in this course.

170
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,860
Donna Cox is a good friend
of mine from the NCSA.

171
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,600
Who taught me a lot of what I
know about data visualization.

172
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
And many other presentation
visualization examples I'll be showing

173
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,750
are her work from the National Center for

174
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,030
Supercomputing Applications here
at the University of Illinois.

175
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,357
And finally, Pat Hanrahan,
professor at Stanford,

176
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:39,828
has been very helpful and
provided a lot of good advice and

177
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:44,191
resources for data visualization,
and I owe him my gratitude as well.
