So what is data visualization? Well, data is stored on a computer. But we want to work with the data, and so we need to get the data somehow out
of the computer and into our heads. So we can think about the data. So we can understand the data. So we can gain insight into
what the data represents. And so the best way we've found to do
that is using visual communication. And so data visualization is a high
bandwidth connection between the computer and the human brain that
transmits as efficiently as possible the data from the computer and
inserts it into our brains. And so here's a sample system,
a typical visualization system, that I've got diagrammed here. We have a scanner here that's
going to acquire data. In this case it's going to use
a laser beam in order to scan. The shape of this graduate student's head,
and then that data gets processed by
the computer into geometry and color, and then it gets displayed
on this display screen. At this point we set up
this visualization, this data visualization channel that's going to
take this data from the display screen. And inserted it into my brain
through this perceptual channel. So, we get this visualization operation
where I'm looking at the data, and it's going through
my perceptual system, going into my human memory and
then I can start to think about it. In this case, there's some strange
things happening with the laser scanning here at the top of the students head. And I want to try to understand
why that's happening. And so data visualization
isn't just about seeing data. It's about understanding data and being
able to make decisions based on the data. And so another example of how data
visualization has been useful. Is when I discovered just
as a university professor. So, students apply for graduate school at Computer Science
at the University of Illinois, and we have a webpage that they use to select
faculty they might want to work with. And so we say, pick out the three
faculty members you'd like to work with, and then we have drop down
menus with all the faculty. And students pick the faculty they
want to work with, and then the students having made that choice, that
information is entered into a database. And for each student applicant, we can see
the faculty they might be interested in working with and
we can start to get an idea for each faculty member what students
they would want to pick from. So, I wanted to plot to see how uniform
this was across the faculty, and so I used a data visualization
tool in order to do this and I came up with a standard bar chart. And, horizontally, these are basically
the different faculty members. There's some faculty members are in our
department, and some are affiliated with our department, and some get more
students interested in working with them, and some get fewer students
working with them, and so horizontally I've got the a faculty
members here and vertically I'm plotting the number of student that want to
work with that faculty member. And so we've got some faculty
members that are very popular and some that aren't very popular and again,
some of the one's that aren't very popular are faculty that
are affiliated with other departments. And students usually apply to work
with them through other departments. And I've eliminated the faculty names
here, just to avoid any embarrassment. So we've got this list and
then I colour code it, the bar charts. This is a stacked bar chart. I've colour coded the bar
charts based on blue, if the faculty member was
a students first choice. Orange if the faculty member was
the students second choice, and green if the faculty member
was the students third choice. And you might see something here, I certainly saw it when I
first plotted this data, and that was that students were picking
people in the first half of the alphabet. This is in alphabetical order. Students are picking faculty from
the first part of the alphabet first, and they're picking people from the second
half of the alphabet mostly last. And then the middle part of the alphabet,
or I should say, they're picking second people
uniformly across the alphabet and what I discovered was that
from this visualization, was that students were picking
faculty in alphabetical order. And having made that discovery
from that visualization, I was able to work back
into the system and figure out why students were picking
faculty in alphabetical order. And the reason was we had three pull
down lists with all the faculty. And so
the students would go down the list and find the first faculty member they
were interested in and click there. They'd go down the list and pick the
second faculty they were interested in and they would select that, and then they would find the third faculty
member they were interested in and click that, and then that would go into
the database, but when we were looking at the database, in order to evaluate
what students might want to work with us. We were assuming students were picking the
faculty they wanted to work with first, as the first choice, and
their second choice was second, and their third choice was third. When in fact, they were just
finding three faculty members and picking them when they
appeared in the list. And so in this case data visualization
helped us make a decision that we wouldn't have
been aware of otherwise. And so that's a hallmark of data
visualization is to provide insight into the data, and
be able to use that insight in order to make further decisions,
further hypotheses to explore further. And so that's the kind of insight
that I want to provide and the tools that I want to provide,
to students in this course. And so we'll work through basically four
weeks of materials on data visualization. The first week, we're just going
to understand the platform for data visualization. Basically, how a computer displays data,
and then how the user perceives and
processes it. And so we'll spend most of the first
week just studying the computer and studying the human. The second week, we'll introduce a few
simple charts, bar charts and so on. And more importantly, we'll look at
the kinds of data that we want to display. That we want to visualize,
and we'll make sure. That we're using the proper chart for
the proper kinds of data. And that the proper kinds of data are being mapped to
the correct elements of that chart. And then we'll also talk about how
to design charts effectively to convey that data. In week three,
we'll look at how to layout and display other data,
non numerical data, relational data. When you're data isn't necessarily
going to be a number that will give you a height and
a bar chart, but is basically a relation that says
item A is related to item B. How do we display that? How do we visualize that? How do we gain insight
into that kind of data? So we spend week three on more looking at abstract data
as opposed to numerical data. And then week four,
we'll talk about visualizing data bases, how to visualize
the results of data mining. And how to analyze the way we work, so the visualization can provide us the
insight into how do we make a decision. And so we'll talk about how to make
a visualization dashboard that gives you the information you need, in order
to make an effective decision, and an informed decision. So I think it's useful to talk about what
we won't be able to cover in these four weeks. We're going to talk about
abstract data visualization. I'm not going to be able to talk in much
detail about specific tools used for visualization, or visualization tools for
scientific visualization or medical visualization, business data,
business intelligence systems and so on. There's a number of tutorials. And manuals for
using specific packages and we just won't have time to
go into any one of them, but i'll try to provide examples across
those different applications. I'll be able to provide,
provide a few design principles, but I won't be able to cover a full course
on visual design for presentation and so there are good courses on that. That you might take a look at,
but, we'll just be looking at some very minimal design principles that
are most effective for data visualization. And this will be an introduction to
the topics of data visualization. And data visualization can
be a very deep subject. And I won't be able to get into
the details of visualization. Will be at sort of a high level of
the different areas of visualization. But focusing on the important
topics of visualization to make any visualization successful,
and to work well. I'll try to provide pointers to tools, but
again, not tutorials on how to use those tools, and
there'll be a couple of assignments in the course, and programming can be used to
complete those assignments and I encourage you to program if you know how to do these
assignments, but it's not required and I'll provide existing tools that you can
use that you don't need to write a program in order to use to visualize your data in
order to complete these assignments and in general to be able to visualize data. And finally, I'd like to thank a few people that have been very
helpful with putting this course together. Eric Shaffer is a lecturer here
at the University of Illinois. And he's talked in one of the most recent
scientific visualization classes we had and he's provided some materials for
me for this class from that. I've very grateful for his help on that. Karrie Karahalios is also a professor of
Computer Science here at the University of Illinois and
she's taught social visualization classes, especially visualizing, kind of
relational data in social situations and she's a world renowned
expert on that area and has provided me with a lot of
resources and website links for tools to help with a variety
of visualization methods. Mike Gleicher is a professor, a friend
of mine at the University of Wisconsin. We just completed a university wide data
visualization course and had some nice material there that he provided me that
I've also been able to use in this course. Donna Cox is a good friend
of mine from the NCSA. Who taught me a lot of what I
know about data visualization. And many other presentation
visualization examples I'll be showing are her work from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications here
at the University of Illinois. And finally, Pat Hanrahan,
professor at Stanford, has been very helpful and
provided a lot of good advice and resources for data visualization,
and I owe him my gratitude as well. [MUSIC]
