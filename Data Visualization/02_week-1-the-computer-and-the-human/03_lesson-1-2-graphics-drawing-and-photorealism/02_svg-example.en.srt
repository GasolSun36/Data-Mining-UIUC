So

2
00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:11,130
if you want to try any of these
scalable vector graphics examples,

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,090
you can go to wthreeschools.com and
there's an SVG tutorial section there.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,320
And it gives you a window here
where you can type in SVG code.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,890
For example, here and
it's output comes here.

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,597
So for example, this one's
setting up a drawing canvas, and

7
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:30,282
it's specified in pixels.

8
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:34,464
So the canvas coordinates are going to
be equal to the display coordinates,

9
00:00:34,464 --> 00:00:39,057
going from 00 here, to 100, 100 here,
it's drawing a circle centered.

10
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:42,553
If, 50/50 in the middle of radius 40.

11
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:46,903
If I can that to a 50 and
then see the results you can see that

12
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:52,050
it's extending out to the boundary
of the drawing canvas.

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,070
We can use this to interactively
change different attributes

14
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,340
of an SVG drawing and
see the results being plotted.

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,912
And that way you can experiment with
different methods for setting up

16
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:19,704
coordinate systems or drawing various
shapes in scalable vector graphics.

17
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:29,538
