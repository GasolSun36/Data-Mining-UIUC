1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,170
When we use three dimensional graphics for
data visualization, we're going to need to

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,740
add photorealism in order to cue us to the
three-dimensional spacial configuration

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,217
of shapes that are being displayed
to us in a two-dimensional image.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,583
So photorealism describes visual cues that
tell our perceptual system that when it

5
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:26,255
see a two-dimensional image, it's seeing
a depiction of a three dimensional scene.

6
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:28,980
Some of these cues are occlusion.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,587
Occlusion is shown here, the fact that
this boys hand is in front of the frame.

8
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:38,600
It's start to trigger your perceptual
system to think that this is

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,681
a three-dimensional scene
of a boy climbing out of

10
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:45,640
the frame instead of a two-dimensional
image of a boy on a frame.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,620
Other things like perspective,
the fact that this water's receding into

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,296
the horizon and details are getting
closer together in the distance.

13
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,782
Others like lighting,

14
00:00:56,782 --> 00:01:00,944
the light bouncing off the forehead
of this boy or attenuation that

15
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:05,046
the water is becoming whiter as
the fog is attenuating the light.

16
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:09,601
All of these add cues, so that your
perceptual system that's looking at

17
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,671
a two-dimensional image
can understand that.

18
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:15,495
It's actually a three-dimensional
scene that's being depicted.

19
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:20,922
One of the strongest cues
of these is occlusion.

20
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:25,392
For example, this red-orange rectangle
is in front of this blue rectangle,

21
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:28,586
because you can see all of
this red-orange rectangle.

22
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:31,431
You can't see all of this blue rectangle,

23
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:36,090
because it's being occluded and
this sets up a depth ordering.

24
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,720
We don't know how much closer
the red-orange rectangle is to us from

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,460
the blue rectangle, but
we do know that it is closer.

26
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,047
An occlusion is the strongest cue and

27
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:51,379
it is fun to play with it with optical
illusions, because of that strength.

28
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:55,934
Illumination helps us perceive
the orientation of surfaces and

29
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:59,990
there's two kinds of illuminations
that we tend to use.

30
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,862
One is diffuse illumination,

31
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:05,462
which is brightest when a surface
is facing a light source.

32
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:10,956
And we usually see this from soft objects,
rough objects, things like cloth or

33
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:16,546
pencil erasers or other surfaces that
are scattering light in many directions.

34
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:21,133
And then there's specular illumination and
that adds these white highlights and

35
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:24,930
we usually see these on shiny objects,
metallic objects.

36
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,480
And these highlights are added in regions
of the surface that are facing in

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,046
a mirror reflection that would reflect
the light source towards the eye.

38
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:39,922
And so, we can combine these when
we're doing data visualization.

39
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:45,842
This is an example of particles that
are leaving trails to show the simulation

40
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:51,504
of the flow of blood in the abdominal
aorta and we're using certain cues.

41
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:56,239
For example, occlusion that some of these
trails are in front of other trails as you

42
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,296
can see this green trail is
in front of the blue trail.

43
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:03,962
We're using lighting, because you can
see that these trails are cylindrical.

44
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:08,171
They have a brighter side and the darker
side, because of diffused sliding.

45
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:12,042
Also loosing perspectives,
we see larger things here and

46
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:15,210
smaller things more detailed at the back.

47
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:21,064
And all of those add up to give you better
sense of the shape of this aorta and

48
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:23,338
the blood flow inside of it.

49
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,129
There's some other cues
that are important.

50
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,671
One is shadowing.

51
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:30,880
Shadowing is an inclusion cue from
a second viewpoint where that second

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,921
viewpoint is at the light source.

53
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,837
So here,
I've got two two-dimensional images.

54
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:40,836
In both cases, we can think of these
due to perspective as a flat blue

55
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:44,256
plain with a red-orange ball on top of it,
but

56
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,043
we don't know if this red orange ball is
hovering over the middle of the plain or

57
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:53,754
if it's laying on the plain
toward the back of it.

58
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:57,022
If I had a shadow,
you can see on the left case here,

59
00:03:57,022 --> 00:04:01,129
the red orange ball is laying on
the blue plane towards its back.

60
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:05,392
But in this case, which is the exact
same image I've just changed the shadow,

61
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:09,545
we can see that this blue ball is hovering
over the middle of the blue square.

62
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:13,503
And so in, for example,
this visualization of a molecule,

63
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:18,394
you can use these shadows to get a better
sense of depth due to the directions

64
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:23,396
that the shadows are being cast from
in understood light source direction.

65
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:28,169
There's also a perspective in addition
to being able to see more detail

66
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,087
far away with perspective.

67
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:33,130
Perspective is based on size constancy.

68
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,337
That objects are the same size,
but farther ones appear smaller.

69
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:41,254
You don't think that the object
is changing its size.

70
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:46,318
You understand that the visual
system is looking at a larger area

71
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:52,413
that's further away, because of the way
it gets projected onto our retina or

72
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:56,754
onto our image plane in
the case of computer graphics.

73
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:01,583
In computer graphics, the way we do
this is we actually make things that

74
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:06,332
are farther away smaller and make
things that are closer to us larger by

75
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:11,504
actually moving the vertices and
then projecting onto a projection plane.

76
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:15,432
And so to get this perspective view where
you've got the front of the table larger

77
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:18,840
than the back of the table,
what we've actually done is actually made

78
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,462
the primitives of the table, larger
in the front and smaller at the back.

79
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:25,493
But computer graphics does this for
you automatically, so

80
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,380
you don't actually have to do this.

81
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,765
And so these examples are demonstrated
in this animation from

82
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:39,705
the National Center for Supercomputing
Application on an F3 tornado.

83
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:42,421
And you can see, we're using perspective.

84
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:48,293
The perspective allows us to see the
glyphs in the front of this visualization

85
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:53,461
and also the patterns that these
glyphs form as you go farther away.

86
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:58,101
And so this is a storm chaser view and you
can see the occlusions of these arrows, so

87
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:01,398
you can get a sense and
the arrows are larger in the front and

88
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:02,930
smaller in the back.

89
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,078
So you can get a sense of the depth of the
simulation of this tornado and the paths

90
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:12,921
that these particles are tracing, and
also we see shadows on the ground.

91
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:16,467
Shadows being cast of one
primitive to another and

92
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:21,281
also the lighting that these
primitives are illuminated on one side

93
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:26,350
better than they're illuminated or
more brightly than on another side

94
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,089
to give you a sense that the shape
of these arrows are cylindrical.

95
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,617
Also, as the storm chaser
moves through the dataset,

96
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:39,462
things in the front are moving by
the viewer faster than things in the back.

97
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:42,879
That's another 3D cue
called motion parallax.

98
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,087
And finally, there's stereo.

99
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:49,504
We can use stereo in
the absence of other cues.

100
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:54,261
In this case, I was just plotting points
of a mathematical equation to create

101
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:58,431
some shapes and the way you visualize
this is you hold your fingers up

102
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,671
in front of your two eyes and
right across your eyes.

103
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,553
So that your right eye is
looking at the left image and

104
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:08,942
your left eye is looking at the right
image, basically by focusing on the finger

105
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:12,628
until those two images in
the background start to merge together.

106
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:17,491
If you do that, then you get a stereogram
and this two-dimensional set of points on

107
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:22,090
this image plane should pop-out into
a three-dimensional configuration.

108
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:27,296
If you want to simulate this, then you can
simulate this with two separate views.

109
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:30,033
A view from a left eye and
a view from a right eye,

110
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,962
looking in parallel at the data.

111
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:34,379
Just make sure you don't
rotate those views.

112
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:38,004
You want to make sure
the views are in parallel.

113
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:39,546
So, what did we learn?

114
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:44,209
We learned that occlusion is
the strongest of all the depth cues and

115
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:49,046
that shadowing is an occlusion from
a viewpoint at the light source.

116
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:50,825
Illumination is useful for

117
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:55,546
surface orientation that helps reveal
details and perspective gives us

118
00:07:55,546 --> 00:08:00,587
different scales of visualization in
addition to adding depth perception.

119
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:03,446
And when none of these
cues are available to us,

120
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:06,170
sometimes some of
the other cues can be used.

121
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,880
For example, stereo.

122
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,520
We can use stereo in
the absence of other cues.

123
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,976
In this case, I was just plotting points
of a mathematical equation to create some

124
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:17,504
shapes.

125
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:22,285
And the way you visualize this is you hold
your finger up in front of your two eyes

126
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:27,138
and try to close your eyes, so that your
right eye is looking at the left image and

127
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:29,837
your left eye is looking
at the right image.

128
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:34,136
Basically, by focusing on the finger until
those to images in the background start to

129
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:35,620
merge together.

130
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,357
If you do that, then you get a stereogram
and this two-dimensional set of points on

131
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:44,838
this image plane should pop-out into
a three-dimensional configuration.

132
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:50,005
If you want to simulate this, then you can
simulate this with two separate views.

133
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:54,755
A view from a left eye and a view from a
right eye looking in parallel at the data.

134
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:57,712
Just make sure you don't
rotate those views.

135
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:59,629
You want to make sure
the views are in parallel.

136
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,602
We learn that occlusion is
the strongest of these depth cues and

137
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:08,129
we learned that shadows are just
occlusion from a light source.

138
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:12,784
We also learned that illumination cues
us to the orientation of surfaces and

139
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,966
we also learned that perspective,

140
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:18,547
allows us to visualize multiple
scales in the same image.

141
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:28,547
[MUSIC]
