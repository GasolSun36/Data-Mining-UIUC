1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,000
When we're using
three-dimensional graphics for

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,740
data visualization, often we don't want
something that looks like a photograph.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,620
We want something that looks
more like an illustration.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,010
In this case, we want to use something
called non-photorealistic rendering.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,730
If we can photograph or
render with computer graphics everything,

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,130
then why do we need things
like illustrations?

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,129
And the answer is is that
illustrations can more clearly depict

8
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,690
a three-dimensional configuration
than a photograph can.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,058
And so then the question is how can we use
three-dimensional computer graphics to

10
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:35,250
render an illustration?

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,874
So, a good example of this form
of non-photorealistic rendering

12
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:43,436
is Gray's Anatomy.

13
00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:48,161
And here's an illustration of
the human heart from Gray's Anatomy,

14
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:50,091
and it's not a photograph.

15
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,794
A photograph would be gory and
covered with blood, and

16
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:55,400
it would be hard to see all
of these configurations.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,660
But with an illustration, the artist has
much more control over the lighting, and

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,570
the texturing, and

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,830
the cutaways in order to more clearly
denote the structures of the heart.

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,240
What we'd like to do is be able to do
the same thing with data visualization.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,925
So, for example, if I have a simple
model of a pig, I could render it using

22
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:21,970
photorealistic illumination and occlusion
and fills to get this shape here.

23
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,390
But I could also use non-photorealistic
techniques to get a more cartoony

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,830
version of this pig that conveys
much the same information.

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,160
And you'll notice that this pig has
outline strokes and it has fills.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,556
And so the outline strokes
are created from contours.

27
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:42,681
And from a three-dimensional scene,

28
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:46,571
the way we get those
contours is by tracing them.

29
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:49,496
They create things like silhouette curves,
the border between the shape and

30
00:01:49,496 --> 00:01:50,171
the background.

31
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:55,012
And sometimes this boundary
will cover itself,

32
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:58,561
and other contours of the shading.

33
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:02,858
And so sometimes these contours will
trace behind other surfaces, and

34
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:05,231
so we still need to respect occlusion.

35
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:10,065
So we have to trim away portions of the
contour that are hidden by other regions.

36
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:13,625
But that leaves us with a set
of outlines and a set of regions

37
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:18,375
that we can then render using some
of our vector graphics techniques

38
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:23,030
instead of some of our three-dimensional
photorealistic techniques.

39
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,533
So, when we fill in the surfaces we may
not want to use photorealistic lighting.

40
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:32,682
So, this top line shows a bunch of spheres
rendered with photorealistic lighting.

41
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:37,574
And you can see that, in each case,
we have a diffuse color illumination and

42
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,799
then a white specular highlight.

43
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,330
So we're getting diffuse illumination and
specular illumination.

44
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:51,160
The light source is to the up and
right of the object.

45
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,070
And yet we don't see any information
in the dark side of the moon here,

46
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,489
the dark side of the sphere.

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,470
That's because this is shadowed
because of photorealistic lighting.

48
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,833
You're not going to see any
information in the shadows.

49
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:10,207
You can still see the color of the object
because there's enough ambient light

50
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,137
bouncing around to get the color.

51
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:14,560
But you don't see any
orientation information,

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,990
this very well could be
a disk instead of a sphere.

53
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,760
We know it's a sphere because
of the illuminated side.

54
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,390
And so we can create better depictions,

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,090
better illumination of the sphere
using non-photorealistic illumination.

56
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,090
In this case, replacing
the diffuse illumination here with

57
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,220
a non-photorealistic diffuse illumination
that we get by taking the color map.

58
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,561
In this case, going from red to black,
and then mixing it with

59
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:47,825
a cool-to-warm, in this case,
blue to yellow color map.

60
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:52,898
And that creates a gradation that goes
from a cool form of red, kind of a bluer

61
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:57,516
shade of red, all the way to a warmer
shade of red, kind of an orange.

62
00:03:57,516 --> 00:04:00,367
So, we're going from
a violet to an orange.

63
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:04,489
And then we can apply that to
the entire sphere based on

64
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,622
the orientation of the surface and
the light source.

65
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:12,987
And then we get more information on the
shadowed side of the object in addition to

66
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,018
the illuminated side of the object.

67
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:20,285
And these shapes look even more spherical
than they do in the physical case.

68
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:25,465
So when we're displaying three-dimensional
shapes, in this case, skeletal shapes.

69
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:30,232
With photorealistic illumination you're
not seeing anything in the dark sides of

70
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:34,058
these objects because of the nature
of shadows and illumination.

71
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:38,724
But when we apply non-photorealistic
illumination, we can see these contours.

72
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:43,516
These divots in the bone that are revealed
by this non-photorealistic shading

73
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,920
that are also hidden in
photorealistic shading.

74
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,670
In both cases,

75
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,650
we've also added the contour to better
indicate the outlines of these shapes.

76
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,870
Here's another example.

77
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,520
This is a photorealistic
rendering of a part, and

78
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,307
this is a non-photorealistic
rendering of a part.

79
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:02,713
You're missing all of the shape
information of the orientation

80
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:04,677
of the surface on the shadowed side.

81
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:07,860
And we gain that with our
non-photorealistic shading.

82
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,033
And also the contours help
us see the configuration and

83
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:16,760
the definite occlusion of
the individual pieces.

84
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,344
So whereas photorealistic rendering
focuses on the physics of light,

85
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:24,940
non-photorealistic rendering focuses
on the psychology of perception.

86
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,701
It emphasizes other parts of the image,
for example, the outlines,

87
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,627
the visual contours of the object.

88
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:35,062
And it uses non-photorealistic shading
to better communicate shape that would

89
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:37,289
otherwise take very complex lighting.

90
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:43,949
