00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,161
[SOUND]
So

2
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:10,390
there's a number of really good
books on data visualization.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,080
I've got a couple of them, and I've used
them in putting together this course.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,638
I'd like to talk about
some of them right now.

5
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:21,740
Ed Tufte, the professor at Yale,
has a number of really good books

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,690
on visualization on the presentation
of visual information.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,180
These are mostly on static formats,
basically constructing images and

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,810
being able to understand
the data based on that image.

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,730
And they're mostly focused on
graphic design principles as

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,880
opposed to the computer
processing of information.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,880
To make it more readily available for
visualization.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,090
But it's a good place to start, if you
want to understand sort of the layout and

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,160
the graphic design aspects
of data visualization.

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,070
Also there's a really good book for
scientific visualization,

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,680
called The Visualization Handbook,
and this is by Chuck Hansen and

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,470
Chris Johnson at the University of Utah.

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,084
And it's mostly curated chapters
written by a large number of experts

18
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:19,080
in scientific visualization, or
the visualization of scientific data,

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,981
or in general,
data that's coordinate based,

20
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:27,097
based on scientific instruments or
simulations.

21
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,140
We're going to be talking
about data visualization.

22
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,220
And so, I used as a source book
a little bit this book on information

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,600
visualization by Stuart Card,
Jock Mackinlay and Ben Schneiderman.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,960
And this is another curated
collection of chapters,

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,860
the chapters are research papers.

26
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,360
The version I have came out in 2000,
so it's a little bit older.

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,150
But the fundamentals really haven't
changed in information visualization, and

28
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,880
this was a good book for me to use,

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,110
to sort of get those
fundamentals into this course.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,080
More recently, there's a good book,
Information Visualization Perception for

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,690
Design by Colin Ware at
the University of New Hampshire.

32
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,750
And, this is a book on perceptual
principles applied to data visualization.

33
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,559
So, it tells you how to lay out your data,
so it can be perceived more readily.

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,200
Focusing on user interface and
user interaction issues.

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,187
And, finally, there's a really good,
really recent book, Visualization Analysis

36
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:39,670
& Design, by Tamara Munzner at
University of British Columbia.

37
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,970
And it coves both scientific and
information visualization, and

38
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:50,100
includes task analysis and other user
interface details, that's quite good.

39
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,501
Tamara Munzner is very well respected
in the data visualization community,

40
00:02:56,501 --> 00:03:01,423
and this book just came out,
and so it's very current, and

41
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:07,542
a really good volume of sort of the state
of the art in data visualization.

42
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:16,911
