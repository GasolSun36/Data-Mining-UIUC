So there's a number of really good
books on data visualization. I've got a couple of them, and I've used
them in putting together this course. I'd like to talk about
some of them right now. Ed Tufte, the professor at Yale,
has a number of really good books on visualization on the presentation
of visual information. These are mostly on static formats,
basically constructing images and being able to understand
the data based on that image. And they're mostly focused on
graphic design principles as opposed to the computer
processing of information. To make it more readily available for
visualization. But it's a good place to start, if you
want to understand sort of the layout and the graphic design aspects
of data visualization. Also there's a really good book for
scientific visualization, called The Visualization Handbook,
and this is by Chuck Hansen and Chris Johnson at the University of Utah. And it's mostly curated chapters
written by a large number of experts in scientific visualization, or
the visualization of scientific data, or in general,
data that's coordinate based, based on scientific instruments or
simulations. We're going to be talking
about data visualization. And so, I used as a source book
a little bit this book on information visualization by Stuart Card,
Jock Mackinlay and Ben Schneiderman. And this is another curated
collection of chapters, the chapters are research papers. The version I have came out in 2000,
so it's a little bit older. But the fundamentals really haven't
changed in information visualization, and this was a good book for me to use, to sort of get those
fundamentals into this course. More recently, there's a good book,
Information Visualization Perception for Design by Colin Ware at
the University of New Hampshire. And, this is a book on perceptual
principles applied to data visualization. So, it tells you how to lay out your data,
so it can be perceived more readily. Focusing on user interface and
user interaction issues. And, finally, there's a really good,
really recent book, Visualization Analysis & Design, by Tamara Munzner at
University of British Columbia. And it coves both scientific and
information visualization, and includes task analysis and other user
interface details, that's quite good. Tamara Munzner is very well respected
in the data visualization community, and this book just came out,
and so it's very current, and a really good volume of sort of the state
of the art in data visualization. [MUSIC]
