2
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:08,253
So at this point I think
it's good to basically do

3
00:00:08,253 --> 00:00:11,960
an overview of the different kinds
of visualization that there are.

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,020
For example,
there's mathematical visualization.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,990
This is the visualization of data
generated from a mathematical equation

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,941
that's readily available just by running
a computer program to generate the data.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,310
A good example of this is the Mandelbrot
set here, this black object.

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,000
This is basically a shape
that's in the complex plane,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,230
these are all complex numbers, and

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,590
you get this shape basically by starting
with zero in the complex plane, zero-zero,

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,410
and you take that and you multiply it
times itself and add a constant, and

12
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,860
then multiply that result times itself and
add the same constant.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,440
Then keep multiplying it times
itself adding a constant.

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,920
Depending on which constant you have
corresponds to a point in the complex

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,890
plane.

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,060
And if you start at zero and
keep adding that constant, squaring and

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,969
adding that constant.

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,960
If that goes off to infinity,
you're out in this purplish region.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,680
If that sticks around,
you're in the black region.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,540
Now mathematicians knew that
these dynamics were interesting

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,000
in the early 1900s, but

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,250
they did know how interesting
the dynamics were or what was going on.

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,620
And it wasn't until plotted this.

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,410
Using data visualization to plot
the results of these points,

25
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,550
to find that the dynamics
were very interesting.

26
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,160
You got all this great structure.

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,950
You could zoom into a little section here,
and see even more, and more detail, and

28
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,630
that was something we just hadn't
encountered before in mathematics, and

29
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,710
so visualization kind of revolutionized
this area of mathematics in our

30
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,370
understanding of this area of mathematics
by basically getting the data

31
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:00,100
out of this mathematical equation and
through our visual

32
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,742
perception into a cognitive process so
we could better understand it.

33
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:07,255
So, if If you pick a point inside this and

34
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:12,265
you start to look at the dynamics,
you get what's called a Julia set.

35
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,975
And this plotted in the complex plane.

36
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:17,505
And one of the things
I worked on with this

37
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:22,145
was to take this complex Julia set and
look what's going on in the quaternions.

38
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:25,455
And again, data visualization is
really helpful because you get

39
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:27,280
these whorl patterns.

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,266
That are basically connecting different
parts of this Julia set to other parts of

41
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:34,139
this Julia set through these
additional dimensions, and

42
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,183
you couldn't understand that very well
without actually being able to visualize

43
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:40,138
how those connections are being made.

44
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:46,330
There's also scientific visualization.

45
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,980
And this is the visualization
of scientific data.

46
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,750
And that data tends to either be measured
from real world scientific devices or it.

47
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,490
Comes as the result of a lengthy
expensive supercomputer simulation.

48
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,840
In here visualization can be really
useful because if you have supercomputer

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,080
simulation, you can use the visualization
as the simulation is being generated

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,590
to determine if there's
problems with the simulation or

51
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,780
if you want to steer the simulation
in a more productive direction.

52
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,470
This tends to be coordinate data, spatial
coordinates, XYZ coordinates, time.

53
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,450
It measures things like temperature and
pressure and other physical quantities,

54
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,170
and this is an example from my own work
where we're visualizing sort of the fronts

55
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,010
of the blood flow as it's coming through

56
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,530
a lower aorta that happens
to be has an aneurysm here.

57
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,560
It's bulging.

58
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,200
And the actual calculation of these
fronts requires a tremendous amount of

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,000
computer time.

60
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,010
Work in this area has recently taken as
long as a month to compute these fronts.

61
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,026
But we're able to visualize it
very quickly and interactively so

62
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:08,497
we can see what's going on to better
understand the complicated nature

63
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:13,719
of this flow which is resulting
from millions of simulation steps.

64
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,860
And finally there's
information visualization.

65
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,060
This is the visualization of more
abstract, non-coordinate data.

66
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,920
For example, what we'll look at in our
Data Visualization Course will be,

67
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,530
for example, relationship data.

68
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,140
And this happens to be
a visualization that my students and

69
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,210
I worked on a few years ago, these are
basically connections between different

70
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,450
flicker users on the flicker
photo sharing website.

71
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,290
And there's 7 million of
these connections and so

72
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,100
it's far to many to be able to understand
by looking at just an ordinary.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,570
Graph, but by coloring and
clustering and laying things out,

74
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,680
we can start to see certain people
are more popular and certain

75
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,240
photo collections are gaining
more attention and we can provide

76
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,399
an overview of all of t hat data that
you can then investigate in more detail.

77
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,660
And so it relies more heavily on
this information visualization.

78
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,720
It relies more heavily on
the ability to process the data

79
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,680
from its abstract form into something
geometric, something concrete that we

80
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,960
can then transmit to our brain
from our visual channels.

81
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,140
But that conversion becomes more
challenging with information

82
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,400
visualization, then perhaps it is with
scientific or mathematical visualization.

83
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,890
And there's a variety of different
domains that visualization is used in.

84
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,760
It's used in medical imaging.

85
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,840
For example taking CT Scans and

86
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,840
being able to reconstruct three
dimensional shapes from that so

87
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,941
you can get a better context of where
you are spaciouly and the patient data.

88
00:05:56,941 --> 00:06:02,705
Being able to take business intelligence
information marketing results and being

89
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:08,150
able to present those in a way that makes
it easier to make a business decision.

90
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,580
Educational visualization, this is a
visualization of how quaternions multiply,

91
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,330
that I made a few years ago

92
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,390
that helps the user understand
geometrically what's

93
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,910
going on with an otherwise abstract
four dimensional number system.

94
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:33,367
Or geographic information systems,
taking data that's geographic in nature,

95
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:38,335
and being able to plot that
in ways that helps you reason

96
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,890
about your region, or
about the world as a whole.

97
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,092
And finally,
there's some modes of visualization, and

98
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:50,029
these are important to understand for
data visualization in general.

99
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,860
There's three that we'll go over.,
the first is interactive visualization and

100
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,780
this is the kind of visualization
that's used for discovery.

101
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,510
Basically, a single
investigator would use this.

102
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,180
Maybe one or
two collaborators might join in, but

103
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,750
its basically a single investigator
in front of a computer.

104
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,580
And, plotting data to try to understand
what's going on with the data.

105
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,660
You've got full control of the data and
you can change what data sets and

106
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,630
how it's displayed on the fly in order to
help understand what you're looking at.

107
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,470
And that's different than, for
example, presentation visualization.

108
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,720
Presentation visualization is the kind
of visualization that we use for

109
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,990
communication.

110
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,370
Its a kind of visualization that
you would see in a video or

111
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:45,190
in a slide presentation and
its intended for a large group or

112
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:52,360
mass audience to basically communicate
some aspect of data to that mass audience.

113
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,430
And the difference between
presentation visualization and

114
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,720
interactive visualization,

115
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,560
mainly, is that presentation
visualization doesn't support user input.

116
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,630
So you're just sitting there and

117
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,490
observing, but
you can't really interact with the data.

118
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,850
You're just sort of getting

119
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,840
the data packaged in a way that helps you
understand it, without the interaction.

120
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,840
In between here, there's the Internet
has basically enabled this third mode of

121
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,030
visualization that has been
called interactive storytelling.

122
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,670
And these are presentation visualizations,
but

123
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,600
they are presented via
interactive web pages.

124
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,160
And so they allow the viewer to interact
with the data in some limited fashions.

125
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,480
The viewer can't change the dataset.

126
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,860
But they can sort of investigate
a little bit further and

127
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,950
there's more information that
can be presented all at once,

128
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,220
as it would be with
a presentation visualization.

129
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,110
And so another way of describing
these differences is to visualize

130
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,100
the modes of visualization, and
so I've laid them out in a table.

131
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,490
We can compare them in
terms of user interaction.

132
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,730
Interactive visualization,

133
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,760
the user controls everything including
what data set you're looking at.

134
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,630
In presentation visualization the user is
only observing, there is no interaction.

135
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,150
In interactive storytelling
there's a presentation, but

136
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,560
the user can still filter the data,
or inspect details of the data, but

137
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,500
can't necessarily change the data
set that they're looking at.

138
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,080
There's different graphics
rendering methods.

139
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,270
You would use real-time rendering.

140
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,850
Anytime you're supporting interaction
as you make changes, your

141
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,870
display needs to respond to those changes
so you need real time graphics to do that.

142
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,340
Where as presentation visualization,
the rendering is precomputed and stores,

143
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,109
say on video or images in a slide show.

144
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,250
The target audiences are different.

145
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,790
For presentation visualization,
you're targeting a mass audience,

146
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,900
your colleagues or everybody that goes
to your webpage, whereas the target for

147
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,460
interactive visualization is an individual
investigator or maybe a small group of.

148
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,660
Collaborators that are working
on understanding some data.

149
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,070
And finally, the medium is different.

150
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,050
When you're running
interactive visualization,

151
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,250
you're running software and the Internet
can enable some software to be run, but

152
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,400
it's basically running a software
program on a computer.

153
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,640
In order to display the data.

154
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,490
When you're doing interactive
storytelling, you're working mostly on

155
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:32,120
the Internet or some other information
kiosk that can support a mass audience.

156
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,341
When you're working on
presentation visualization,

157
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:41,547
you're working on slide shows, or
video, or some other format that

158
00:10:41,547 --> 00:10:47,583
allows you to prerecord the visuals, and
then present them to a mass audience.

159
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:57,401
