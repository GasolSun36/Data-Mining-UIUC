1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,150
So when we visualize data we usually
want to make a decision based on

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,930
that data.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,640
That means we need to
reason about the data.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,633
And so we need to learn the different ways
that the human cognitive system reasons.

5
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:19,510
So what we'll learn is how does a human
observer understand a visualization?

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,640
And how does a human observer
respond to a visualization?

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,440
What are they thinking about when they
see this data presented to them visually?

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,670
So we use the model human processor, but
we're going to focus on the cognitive

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,920
processor, and the information provided
to it through the visual image store and

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,440
visual perception, and
how we reason about that information.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,440
And there's three kind of reasoning
that we'll look at, deductive reasoning,

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
inductive reasoning, and
abductive reasoning.

13
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,770
Deductive reasoning is basically
drawing a conclusion based on the data.

14
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,215
It's based on logic, if A then B so,

15
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:05,566
if you see A then you can conclude
that B is going to exist.

16
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,096
And if B doesn't exist you might
conclude that A doesn't exist,

17
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:12,790
because if A happened
then B would've happened.

18
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,584
So these are all valid logical
conclusions based on visual data.

19
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:21,956
Sherlock Holmes used to say,
when you have eliminated the impossible,

20
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,205
whatever remains, however improbably,
must be the truth.

21
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:29,063
And that's basically just
the process of elimination,

22
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:33,895
which is again a deductive reasoning
method for drawing a conclusion.

23
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:37,368
And so, for example,
these reasoning examples,

24
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:40,290
I'm going to use this
life expectancy data.

25
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,010
This is average data for
all countries in the world.

26
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,310
And our life expectancy has grown in
the 1960s from an average of 54 years,

27
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,630
to an average of about 71 years in 2012.

28
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,819
And so based on this data, I might deduce

29
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,399
that I'm one of the members of one of

30
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,180
the countries that was
used to create this data.

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,790
I might expect that my life
expectancy has similarly increased

32
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,140
over the past few decades.

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,490
And that would be a logical conclusion
based on the information from this graph.

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,950
Also you can see a correlation
here anytime you have

35
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,600
a graph that's increasing this way.

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,286
It's showing a correlation
between time and

37
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:38,554
between life expectancy,
and so we're deducing,

38
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:43,893
we are concluding that life
expectancy is increasing over time.

39
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:49,262
And so people nowadays are living longer
than they were a few decades ago,

40
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:52,950
and that's a reasonable deduction.

41
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,880
We have to be careful that this is
showing correlation and not causation.

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,960
And that we're not showing that
because people are growing older,

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
time is passing necessarily.

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,040
There are many other cases
where two items are correlated,

45
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,670
but one does not necessarily
cause the other.

46
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,818
Or you get the causation
in the wrong direction.

47
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:19,661
There's also inductive reasoning,

48
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:24,842
which basically says if something is
true for x then it's true for x +1,

49
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:30,620
and you know that's it's true for x,
so in that case it's true for all x.

50
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,810
If it's true for one specific case,
it's true for all of the cases.

51
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,420
And these are generalizations.

52
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,650
We can use this to extrapolate data,
for example, life expectancy.

53
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,570
I can look at this shape and I might
expect that life expectancy is going

54
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:55,020
to continue to grow at the rate of about
ten years every decade and a half.

55
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,610
And so
eventually we'll live to be 200 years old.

56
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,690
And so some generalizations are helpful,
some generalizations aren't helpful, and

57
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,990
we have to be careful with
those kinds of extrapolations.

58
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,870
Also interpolation, I've got this data
yearly, but I'm drawing this as a smooth

59
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,643
line which is an inductive
reasoning prediction

60
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:26,250
that says that this is varying smoothly in
between the data items, it's interpolated.

61
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:32,030
And it's not varying widely between
an individual year and the next year.

62
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,550
So inductive reasoning allows
us to infer missing data.

63
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,420
It allows us to extrapolate data,
either before or after the graph,

64
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,890
but it's less reliable than deductive
reasoning, but still can be helpful.

65
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,972
And finally, abductive reasoning.

66
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:53,917
This is based on sort of the human
need for meaning, to ask why.

67
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:58,529
And so given this data that life
expectancy on average has been

68
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:01,456
increasing over the past few decades,

69
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:07,650
we might start to ask why is that
the case, and we might create models.

70
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,910
And so in this case the graph is
increasing almost like a straight line,

71
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,230
and so you can do regression.

72
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,750
You can fit a line to this data and
create a model for this data.

73
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,310
And you can use that model
to replace the data, and

74
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,360
in our minds we might not think of
every single detail of this data.

75
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,430
And we might think in general,
the data is growing at the rate

76
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,569
of our life expectancies, growing at the
rate of ten years every decade and a half.

77
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,640
And those models are good but
they create a problem.

78
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,985
For example, cognitive dissonance,

79
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:49,250
it's our ability to entertain simultaneous
contradictory opinions at the same time.

80
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,595
So it may be difficult for
us to think of two things,

81
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:58,649
two opposite models at the same time,
even though we don't

82
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:04,080
know which model is correct,
and so we tend to take sides.

83
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,130
And if our evidence disagrees with our
model, sometimes the model is so powerful

84
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,930
in our minds, that we tend to disregard
the evidence, and that can be dangerous.

85
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,850
And so as we go about with visualization,
we have sort of the baggage of

86
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,120
our models, our expectations
of the way the world works,

87
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,180
and our abductive reasoning is trying
to fit this data to those models.

88
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,560
So there are three different
kinds of reasoning.

89
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,945
There's deduction,
where we draw a conclusion.

90
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:37,134
There's induction,
where we make a generalization.

91
00:06:37,134 --> 00:06:41,728
And then there's abduction, where we
try to predict how an event happened.

92
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:46,409
And all three of those are at play
when we're understanding the data that

93
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,720
we're seeing in a visualization.
