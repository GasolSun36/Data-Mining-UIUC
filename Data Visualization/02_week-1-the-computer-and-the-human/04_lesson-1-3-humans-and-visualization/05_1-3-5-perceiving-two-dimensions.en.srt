1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,830
So we perceive light with our retina, but

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,420
it still needs to be processed on
its way to our cognitive system.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,020
That processing is performed by ganglia.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,060
And that's how we perceive
individual impulses of light and

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,770
turn them into actual shapes.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,140
So as we present data
visually to a human observer,

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,690
we want to make sure that that
data is perceived correctly.

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,120
And that means that the data
that's sensed by the rods and

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,190
cones in our retina ends up
being processed further by our

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,980
perceptual system before it even
gets to our cognitive system.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,800
How can we make sure that the visual
data is going to be presented so

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,690
that it's perceived properly and
correctly?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,729
So in the Model Human Processor,

14
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:51,009
this data that's coming from the human
retina goes through a visual image store.

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,678
Where it goes through significant
perceptual processing,

16
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:58,130
before you even think about it, before
you even realize what you're looking at.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,750
And this perceptual processing starts

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,720
right after the data has been
sensed by the rods and cones.

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,680
This is an image from Gray's Anatomy, and

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,800
you can see that as soon as
the data has been sensed,

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,080
we've got other cells, these nerves called
ganglia, that are processing the data.

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,610
In this case a horizontal cell is
actually comparing the results

23
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,530
of what's being sensed by the rods and
the cones.

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,160
And this helps us to detect patterns and
accentuate and

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,210
exaggerate differences
in neighboring sensors.

26
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,447
This helps us detect edges and motion and
tigers hiding in the bush because

27
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:45,698
tigers hiding in the bush will create
patterns in our peripheral vision.

28
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:47,571
And those patterns can change over time.

29
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:50,865
And these horizontal cells
that are comparing and

30
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:54,953
exaggerating those differences
can tell us to then run away.

31
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:58,801
So for example,
when we see a shade of gray,

32
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:03,810
we see that in context of
the surrounding shades of gray.

33
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,170
And so here we have a gray color
surrounded by a lighter color.

34
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,955
And here we have a gray color
surrounded by a darker gray color.

35
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:16,040
And this box looks like
it's darker than this box,

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,620
so this is a darker shade
of gray than this gray.

37
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,650
When in fact those two shades
of gray are identical.

38
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,588
They're the same shade of gray.

39
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:29,724
It's just when we surround them with
these boxes in different context,

40
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:34,568
our perceptual system will
accentuate the difference.

41
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:39,076
And make this gray look darker,
and this gray look brighter.

42
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,890
When in fact,
they're the same shade of gray.

43
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,830
This also works with color.

44
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,550
And so on the left block I,

45
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,380
you can see that these two
block I's are the same color.

46
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,315
But here the color appears lighter,

47
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:59,298
because these squares
are next to white squares.

48
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:03,230
And here they appear darker because
these squares are next to green squares.

49
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:09,270
And you can also demonstrate
this with Mach bands.

50
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,150
Here I've got a gradation
from dark gray to light gray.

51
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,760
And here I've got a plot of basically
the number of photons coming from each of

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,710
these bands to our eye.

53
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,030
And in fact, what our rods and
cones are sensing for

54
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,510
each one of these bands is
proportional to this graph.

55
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,483
What's actually being sent to our brain
from our perceptual system though looks

56
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:33,220
like this.

57
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,188
And you can see that this flat gray
rectangle next to this lighter

58
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:43,370
gray rectangle,
this darker rectangle gets darker here.

59
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,858
And this lighter rectangle
is lighter here.

60
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:51,670
You can see it get lighter here and
that's not because I've changed any color.

61
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,850
This is all the same shade of gray.

62
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,568
It's that our visual system is
making this shade of gray brighter

63
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:01,331
because it's next to a darker color.

64
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:05,951
And our visual system wants to
accentuate the existence of

65
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:10,770
this edge when these two shades
are very close to each other.

66
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,052
And this can cause problems too.

67
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:16,131
In this case we've got
the lateral inhibitors,

68
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:20,348
which are these cells comparing
neighboring rod and cone values.

69
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:24,079
In our peripheral vision,
if I look at any one of these junctions,

70
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,830
I see a solid gray color.

71
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,420
But the junctions and

72
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,170
neighboring cells start to flicker
black and white because of this

73
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,860
lateral inhibition of our perceptual
system trying to accentuate those edges.

74
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,725
This also works with orientations,

75
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:45,560
our perception of orientation is also
based on sort of this local comparison.

76
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,750
And so
these lines look like they are diverging.

77
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,970
It looks like these two parallel lines
are getting further apart as they

78
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,816
move this direction because they
are the sum of all of these intersections

79
00:04:56,816 --> 00:05:00,280
that are slightly askew from these cubes.

80
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,920
But if I remove these cubes, you see
that these lines really are parallel.

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:11,435
And the perception that the lines are not
parallel is basically because of adding up

82
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:16,941
all of those misperceptions of
orientations due to the offset cubes.

83
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:24,322
Similarly, I can take this diamond
shape made from four straight lines and

84
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:28,131
if I superimpose on top of these four
straight lines of this diamond shape

85
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:30,300
a bunch of concentric circles.

86
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,490
This diamond shape, these lines start
to look like they're bowed inside.

87
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,270
And that's because the orientation
of this line is based on

88
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:45,160
our perception of
the orientations relative to

89
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,230
these concentric circles, and
we get this bowing effect.

90
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,920
At a much higher level,
it can also confuse our cognitive system.

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,537
In this case,
we have an 8 x 8 block of shapes and

92
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:05,021
that should give us 64
units squared of area.

93
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:09,809
If I take these very same shapes and
reorganize them here,

94
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:16,560
I'm now covering a 13 x 5 area which
gives me 65 unit squares of area.

95
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,500
And so somehow I've taken the same
shape with the same area.

96
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,250
And gotten an extra unit
square of area on the right.

97
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,540
And the reason is the accuracy of
our perception of orientation.

98
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:39,509
We have basically this triangle's angle
going into this rhombus' angle here.

99
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,479
And the slope of these triangles
is basically three-eighths.

100
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,405
And the slope of these quadrilaterals,

101
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:53,064
this edge of this
quadrilateral is two-fifths.

102
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:55,070
And two-fifths is just not
equal to three-eighths but

103
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,270
we just don't see the difference.

104
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,400
We also see size in context.

105
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,470
And so here I have two blue discs.

106
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,240
This blue disc is sitting
amidst some small yellow discs.

107
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,480
And this blue disc is sitting
amidst some large yellow discs.

108
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,450
And this blue disc looks
large as a result and

109
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,920
this blue disc looks small as a result.

110
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,950
But in fact they are the same size,
and so we see things in

111
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:29,410
context because of these local comparisons
that our perceptual system does.

112
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,950
So lateral inhibition helps us perceive
shapes by emphasizing edges and

113
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,420
other differences.

114
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,580
But lateral inhibition can also interfere
with data visualization when we have

115
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,800
big changes in data happening
close to each other.

116
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,350
So we have to understand how
the human visual system works

117
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,550
at this higher perceptual level so

118
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,680
that we can more effectively use it
to display data to be perceived.

119
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,341
For example, we want to make sure we're
sensitive to the context of the data.

120
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:02,899
And that we keep data in the same
context when we're making comparisons.
