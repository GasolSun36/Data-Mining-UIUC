1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,830
So the point of data visualization is
to get data out of the computer and

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,490
into the human brain.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,547
And part of that process is going
to be memorizing that data and

4
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:12,271
learning from that data.

5
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:15,280
And so we have to understand
how human memory works.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,890
So we're going to learn what's
the difference between,

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,300
for example, short-term memory, and
long-term memory and sensory memory?

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,440
And how can we get things between
short-term and long-term memory?

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,610
How can we remember things better?

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,590
And, essentially,
how can we can learn better?

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,070
So we'll start again with this model human
processor, except we'll reorganize it.

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,330
I want to focus on the memory of this and
that's the visual image store,

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,920
the auditory image store,
the working memory, the long-term memory.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,560
And these are connected by the perceptual
processors and the cognitive processors.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,270
And so I can reorganize this,
we have the sensory image stores

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,640
go to the perceptual processor, which
places information in the working memory.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,820
Which then goes to
the cognitive processor and

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,450
places information in
the long-term memory.

19
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,440
And this process of taking
information from your senses and

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,070
putting it in the working
memory is based on attention.

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,200
And when you're paying attention
to something, like, for

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,330
example, the fact that I'm pointing
the pointer and talking to you right now.

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:25,910
You are taking the elements in your
very very short-term sensory stores.

24
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,110
And you are processing them and
putting them in your working memory.

25
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,265
Now because this is classroom material,
you want to remember that.

26
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:36,730
And so you need to take these details
that I'm describing to you and

27
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,560
take them from working memory and
put them in long-term memory.

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,380
And that's a process that's
usually called rehearsal.

29
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,170
There's a number of ways to do that,
but it's effectively called rehearsal.

30
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,610
And you'll notice working memory
only holds about seven items.

31
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:57,640
And those items are available for
about seven seconds.

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,359
You can hold one item much longer, but for
several items it's about seven seconds.

33
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,490
Before they decay, and
I've got several things on the screen.

34
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,290
So you're processing each of these like
the perceptual store attention and

35
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,488
perceptual processor.

36
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:14,030
And trying to rehearse those and

37
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,619
put those in long-term memory before
you try to memorize these other things.

38
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,920
So, sensory memory is really
short-term device memory.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,370
On a cell phone, it would be the CCD
array that's recording the image data.

40
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,240
And it'd be the registers
that are used to store and

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,140
organize that information before
being sent as an image to the CPU.

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,460
Visually, we have iconic memory,
this is persistence of vision.

43
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,360
You look at something
flashed on the screen, and

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,920
you can remember it even
though it's not there anymore.

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,720
That's your iconic memory,
your visual sensory memory,

46
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,030
it only last about half a second.

47
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,780
You have echoic memory for hearing
things that lasts for about one and

48
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,340
a half seconds.

49
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,769
And then you have haptic memory,
which you can remember touch as well.

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,320
And then, these constants can go up or
down based on arousal.

51
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,800
How much attention are you paying?

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,951
Arousal means that you're
paying more attention.

53
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:23,875
And that can increase both
the severity of the memory and

54
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,820
how long it lasts in your memory.

55
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,905
And these things get placed
into working memory so

56
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:32,700
your cognitive processor can process them.

57
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,490
And this is like human dynamic RAM
memory because it needs to be refreshed.

58
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,530
It dies about every 200 milliseconds,
and so it needs to be refreshed.

59
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,630
And it has about 70
milliseconds access time.

60
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,970
But it's very small, it only holds
about seven chunks, digits or

61
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,490
words, seven things.

62
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,231
And again recency effects are important,
the last thing that goes in the memory is

63
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:05,779
usually the strongest and things start
to fade after a certain amount of time.

64
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,996
And so we can have fun looking at
the working memory figuring out how things

65
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:16,160
are organised in our short-term
working memory that we use to process.

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:24,440
So I can give you a sequence of digits,
here's a sequence of digits 25439762608.

67
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,640
And I'll hide those now, now,
what were those numbers?

68
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,860
If you're like me, I can remember
maybe two, three, something or other.

69
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,730
I don't remember any of those digits.

70
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,520
And that's because it
overflowed my working memory,

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,290
I couldn't remember that many Items for
that long.

72
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,513
Let me take another set of the same number
of items, these are going to be different

73
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:50,742
items, different numbers, but
the same number of digits.

74
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:55,081
456 295 1413, and you notice we've

75
00:04:55,081 --> 00:05:00,580
organized them into chunks, 456 295 1413.

76
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,910
Now I hide them and
I can remember 456 293 1413.

77
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:13,104
Oop, and I got wrong,
456 295 1413, 456 295 1413.

78
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:17,089
Because I'm remembering chunks
instead of individual digits.

79
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:21,809
And you can do the same thing, same
thing is true for characters and words.

80
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:28,771
Here's some random characters,
HEC, ATR, ANU, PTH, ETR, EET.

81
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:33,347
If I hide those, I don't know if you can
remember those particular characters.

82
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:37,478
But I can remember them,

83
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,004
those characters are HEC,

84
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:46,340
ATR, ANU, PTR, EET.

85
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,490
And the reason I can remember them
is that if I start with this T, and

86
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,350
then go back to the beginning,
this spells out, the cat ran up the tree.

87
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,970
And I can remember the cat ran up
the tree, that's only five words.

88
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,560
Whereas, I'm looking at 18
different letters here,

89
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,460
which would overflow my working memory.

90
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,380
So, items are processed better
in working memory when we chunk

91
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,300
them together into higher level objects.

92
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,250
Then once things are in our short-term
memory, our working memory,

93
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,372
we need to get them in our long-term
memory, so we can remember them later.

94
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:28,870
And long-term memory is kind of
like the human world wide web,

95
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,450
it's a persistent memory.

96
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,040
It's effectively infinite and
lasts forever.

97
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,070
And there's two types of long-term memory,
there's episodic memory and

98
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,640
semantic memory.

99
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,700
Episodic memory is time bearing memory,

100
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,010
we remember sequences, events,
things that are organized temporally.

101
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,410
This is how we remember songs,
you remember the lyrics.

102
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,500
And you may not be able to remember every
word to a song unless you sing the song to

103
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,630
get to that word.

104
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,643
And semantic memory is
memory that's facts, but

105
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:05,025
they're organized associatively,
there's links.

106
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:09,324
So you get this stream of consciousness
where you you remember one thing.

107
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,665
And then you can remember
something related to that, and

108
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,846
something related to that.

109
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,250
And so there's various representations for
these kinds of memories.

110
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,390
There's semantic nets,
which are really just a graph.

111
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,620
There's frames, which are kind
of a database with fields and

112
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,260
entries that you can create relations and
create the associations between them.

113
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,920
And then there's scripts,
which are similar to frames,

114
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,690
that basically define the roles, scenes,
props and so on for various memories.

115
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,690
So when we go through
the process of remembering,

116
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,840
there's a couple concepts to keep in mind.

117
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,520
One is the total time hypothesis.

118
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,870
And that says that you can remember
something if you spend more time with it.

119
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,179
The more time you spend on something,
the more likely you are to remember it.

120
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,690
This could be memorizing by rote,
where you just keep repeating something.

121
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,600
But it's not necessarily
best to always repeat and

122
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,920
learn something by repeating it over and
over again.

123
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,000
It's sometimes better to remember things
by working with them differently,

124
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,580
but still spending time on them.

125
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,650
There's the distribution
of practice effect,

126
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,120
which means you can't memorize
a bunch of stuff all at once.

127
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,260
It's better to memorize a few things at
a time, and then go do something else.

128
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,310
And then come back and
remember a few things at a time.

129
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:37,150
By distributing the memories over
a wider time and not all at once.

130
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,040
Concrete things are easier to
remember than abstract things.

131
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,660
And so we remember meanings.

132
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,080
So if I read off the words faith,
age, cold, tenet, quiet,

133
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,630
logic, idea, value, past.

134
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,300
Those are harder to remember.

135
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,540
But if I read off,
because they're abstract concepts.

136
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,947
If I read off more concrete objects
like boat, tree, cat, child, rug,

137
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:05,198
plate, gun, flame, head,
they tend to paint a picture in your mind.

138
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:08,350
And it becomes a little bit easier for
you to remember those.

139
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,570
And so we tend to memorize
things based on structure,

140
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,930
based on familiarity,
mostly based on concreteness.

141
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,728
So in the right, I've got an example,
if you want to memorize numbers,

142
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:22,606
if you have the digits 1 through 0,
effectively 1 through 10 here.

143
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:27,988
But 1 through 0, and you want to
memorize along sequence of numbers,

144
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:33,113
for example, pie,
if you don't remember pi is 3.14159.

145
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:36,592
If it's difficult to remember those
digits, those arbitrary digits.

146
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:40,308
You can make them more concrete
by associating each digit with

147
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:43,320
a concrete word that rhymes with it.

148
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,147
So instead of 314,
you remember tree bun door.

149
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:50,546
And the words tree, burn,
door start to paint a picture.

150
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:54,826
And if I go tree, burn,
door, burn hive wine,

151
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:58,260
I start to tell a little bit of a story.

152
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,959
And you can start using more of your
episodic memory to remember these

153
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,330
abstract ideas.

154
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,400
We also forget, even when things
are put in our long-term memory.

155
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,950
They will decay over time, and
that decay is logarithmic.

156
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,520
We forget most things earlier and
then we forget fewer things longer away,

157
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,070
this leads to Jost's Law.

158
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,401
If you have two equally strong memories,

159
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:24,270
then the older of the two
memories is more durable.

160
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,961
If you don't forget something quickly,

161
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:33,450
then your chances of memorizing
it forever are much greater.

162
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,890
And then there's interference,
one of the reasons we forget things

163
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,000
is that we learn things that
conflict with that memory.

164
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,560
For example,

165
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,190
there's proactive inhibition which means
you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

166
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,805
If you've learned something one way,
then that one way, which has been in your

167
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:55,120
long=term memory for a long time,
is going to be a strong memory.

168
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,459
And it's going to be difficult to rewrite
that memory with new information.

169
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,838
Because that old memory is so
much stronger and

170
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:04,660
you're more likely to forget things
you've learned more recently.

171
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,822
There's also retroactive interference.

172
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:12,464
This is when you've just received so
much information t

173
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,130
hat you start to forget things
because of the amount of information.

174
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,390
This is, for example,
why it's not good to cram for an exam.

175
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:24,113
Because you're filling your brain with so
much information that the more recent

176
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:27,525
information is overriding
the less recent information.

177
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:32,298
And because the information is less
recent, it's less strong in your memory.

178
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:35,790
And finally, emotion,
we remember the good old days,

179
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,440
we forget the mundane day-to-day details
that were boring about the good old days.

180
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,560
You remember things based
on strong emotions.

181
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,210
And so, if you can change your
emotional state when you're studying,

182
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,680
that might help, but
it might also exhaust you.

183
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,920
But it does have an impact on how you
remember and how you forget things.

184
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,210
So there's three different
kinds of memory.

185
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,280
There's sensory memory
that decays very quickly.

186
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,320
There's working memory that
contains just a few objects that

187
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,430
don't last for very long.

188
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,610
And then there's long-term memory and

189
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,404
things get into our long-term memory
through a process of learning.

190
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:16,430
And we can improve our learning if
we can vary our learning styles.
