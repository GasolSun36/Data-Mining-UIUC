1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,010
So when we display data the data will then
need to be perceived by a human observer.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,890
That perception starts
with the human retina.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,472
And so, we need to understand
how the retina perceives light.

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:16,587
We're going to learn about the eye and
how does the eye sense light.

5
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:21,495
And based on that knowledge of how
the eye physically senses the light,

6
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:26,145
we can figure out how small the details
of a visualization can be and

7
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:29,415
what color should you
use in a visualization.

8
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:33,629
So we're going to focus on the eye,
and the mechanics of the eye.

9
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:39,530
And this is a image of the eye and
illustration from Grey's Anatomy.

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,340
And the eye consist of a lens
that focuses the light

11
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:52,740
that receives from the aperture
that is control by this iris.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,110
And it focuses that
light onto this retina.

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,140
And this retina contains the sensors that
basically determine what light is hitting,

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,380
what part of this image plane.

15
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,060
So we don't have an image plane,
it's more of a hemisphere.

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,690
And the important part here
is this fovea centralis.

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,980
This is your center of vision.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,097
When you look at something, it's because
that something you're looking at is

19
00:01:15,097 --> 00:01:17,379
getting focused onto the fovea centralis.

20
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:21,222
This is where you have a lot of sensors
that can tell a lot of detail about what

21
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:25,020
you're looking at, then less sensors
as you get farther away from that.

22
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,700
You also have an optic nerve that
connects to your retina, and

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,100
you don't have any sensors here to be able
to see the light that's coming in, so

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,380
there's a blind spot that we have, and we
don't even realize we have the blind spot,

25
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,760
because our perceptual system
is covering it up with,

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,980
in a way that we don't
even realize is happening.

27
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,860
So this leads to visual acuity,
the notion of visual acuity.

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,550
How sharp is your vision?

29
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:00,060
What can you see, how small of
a detail can you present to a viewer?

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,310
And we measure our visual acuity
when we go to an eye doctor,

31
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,212
when we look at one of these eye charts
and it tells us our Snellen ratio.

32
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:11,804
20/X, which means you can distinguishes
at 20 feet what the average

33
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:14,270
person can distinguish at X feet.

34
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,180
So if you can only see this letter E,
then you have 200 vision,

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,230
meaning you can see this E at 20 feet
when the average person can see this E

36
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,850
even as far away as 200 feet.

37
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,510
And if you can see below this red line,

38
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,760
you have better than 20/20,
better than average vision.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,810
And the reason you can distinguish these
letters [COUGH] is that their features

40
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,680
project to a certain distance
apart on the retina, and

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,230
if your lens is doing a good job
of focusing that information,

42
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,480
then the sensors on your retina
can resolve those details.

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,020
If your lens is not doing such a good job,
then the image that's getting presented

44
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,480
isn't going to be resolved
as well by your sensors.

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,390
And so, your retina basically is
going to consist of rods and cones.

46
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,830
Rods perceive the brightness and
cones perceive color.

47
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,650
And there's three varieties of cones.

48
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,082
Cones that perceive mostly red colors,
[COUGH] cones that perceive

49
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:24,223
mostly red colors,
cones that perceive mostly green colors,

50
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:27,922
and cones that perceive
mostly blue colors.

51
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:32,796
And then, there's a variety of
additional processing that happens by

52
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:37,030
the ganglion's,
these other nerve cells after the retina.

53
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,440
But this rods and cones are useful
to look at for the moment.

54
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,490
You have 80 million rods and
only 5 million cones.

55
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:54,379
So your intensity vision is much
better by your color vision.

56
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,580
Your rods are denser away from the fovea.

57
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,330
Your fovea, your center of vision,
is mostly cones, as it turns out.

58
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,240
So astronomers have learned, when they're
looking at very dim stars, to look

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,800
slightly away from the star, look slightly
off to the side of what they're studying.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,779
So that their rods can process
the information and not their cones,

61
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,421
because their rods are more
sensitive to the changes in light.

62
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:26,880
And they're quite sensitive, they
don't even turn on when it's daylight.

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,036
And then, you have cones,
and they're, again,

64
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:36,171
sensitive to various colors or
various wavelengths of light.

65
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:41,719
They're very dense in the fovea,
anywhere from a 100,000

66
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:47,069
to 325,000 cones per millimeter
squared in the fovea and

67
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,635
they can distinguish about 150 hues and

68
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:56,610
combined between the different hues,
a hue is a colour in the rainbow.

69
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,944
And the different shades and intensities
and saturations, you end up with

70
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:05,296
about 7 million different shades that
you can distinguish with your eye.

71
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:09,742
Depending on how on your lens,

72
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:13,870
all lenses exhibits some form
of chromatic aberration.

73
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,700
And that means that refraction
depends on the wavelength of light.

74
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,110
Light at the red wavelengths is
going to focus at a different

75
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,390
location than light in the green
wavelengths to the blue wavelengths, and

76
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:32,550
this creates a dispersion that
can create problems of focus, and

77
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,370
this is why blue blocker sunglasses or
amber sunglasses which are nothing more

78
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,220
than just amber shaded
filters on your sunglasses.

79
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,290
They're going to age our vision because
they're filtering out blue light and

80
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,060
blue tense to focus off
the retina whereas red and

81
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,230
green tend to focus closer to the retina.

82
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,680
So the blue wavelengths are actually
blurring the image and the red and

83
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,170
green wavelengths are generally
sharper on the retina.

84
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,870
So it'd be good to avoid pure blue text or

85
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,128
at least desaturate it with
a little bit of red or

86
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:13,421
green colors to aid in focusing on
edges of text or important figures.

87
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:16,470
There's some interesting
properties of color,

88
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,899
this isn't necessarily chromatic
aberration, but we tend to perceive

89
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:26,230
the red is being closer than the blue, and
this is our part of our perceptual system.

90
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,850
For color perception, there's
a difference in brightness, as well.

91
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,010
Blue is generally a darker
color than red or green.

92
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,920
If you look at the pure
luminance of a color,

93
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,210
the luminance of that color will be
30% of its red component + 59% of

94
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,600
its green component + 10%
of its blue component.

95
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,820
That means that green is six
times as bright as blue, and

96
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,330
green is twice as bright as red and
red three times as bright as blue.

97
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,820
And if you have yellow,

98
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,570
you can create yellow in the additive
color system by red plus green.

99
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,713
Yellow is very bright.

100
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:08,046
It's 31% plus 59% gives
you 90% brightness.

101
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:14,820
And you can figure out the luminance
of these other colors based on that.

102
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,590
Also, it's important to acknowledge
that a good number of people,

103
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,030
in particular, 10% of males,
are color blind.

104
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,450
And if you're displaying
information with color,

105
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,680
you may want to add additional
ques to that information.

106
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,600
So that people that are color
blind can also understand it,

107
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,520
and also to pay attention to contrast.

108
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,940
Because if you're displaying
something only with color,

109
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,530
then people who are color blind aren't
going to be able to tell the difference.

110
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,740
Just color contrast and so you may want to
change the brightness of the color as well

111
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,940
and use this formula to make sure enabling
colors have different brightnesses and

112
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,470
addition to different use.

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,810
And these colors, these red, green and

114
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,630
blue colors yet
change into a different color space.

115
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,740
Space brightness, brightness shade.

116
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,910
And then, a brightness minus blue, and

117
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:17,420
a red minus green channel.

118
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,359
So you get a color space that goes
from black to white, yellow to blue,

119
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,629
and red to green.

120
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,750
This is the black white channel,
this is the yellow blue channel.

121
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,150
And this is the red green channel.

122
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,900
That's what actually gets into
the brain after some processing

123
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,310
of the retinal image.

124
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,484
And so, you're cones and
rods will start to get

125
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:50,220
exhausted [COUGH] if you stare at the plus
sign in the middle of the screen here,

126
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,570
you'll start to see that the purple dot
that's missing instead of missing will

127
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:02,290
start to turn green because it's turning
into the complement of the purple color.

128
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,270
And once it starts, if you keep staring at
the plus eventually that green dot will

129
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,640
eat up the rest of the dots and
you're left with a solid gray screen.

130
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,510
And this is all due to, basically,
some exhaustion of the rods and

131
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,220
cones in your perceptual system.

132
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,630
So the human retina perceives
light using rods and cones.

133
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,960
Cones perceive color,
rods perceive brightness.

134
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,440
We have more cones near our fovea,
our center of vision, and

135
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,650
more rods in our peripheral vision.

136
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,056
Also, we tend to expect warmer
colors to be in the forefront,

137
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,421
and cooler colors to be in the background.
