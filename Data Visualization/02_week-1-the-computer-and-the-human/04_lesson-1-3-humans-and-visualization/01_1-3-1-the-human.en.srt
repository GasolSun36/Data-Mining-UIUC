1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,470
So in data visualization, we're using
a computer to display data to a human.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,360
And now we need to focus on how
the human perceives that data.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,970
And so, I'd like to spend the next
few videos talking about the human,

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,210
which is sometimes a foreign subject
to many computer science students.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,341
We can use what's called the model human
processor to describe how a human works in

6
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:25,129
terms of how a computer works.

7
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,628
So here's a computer.

8
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:32,050
This might be a diagram of a computer
that might be computer in a cellphone,

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,089
for example.

10
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:37,172
You're going to have a CPU,
some central processing unit.

11
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:38,250
And there'll be memory.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,330
You'll have Cache memory and then RAM.

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,930
The Cache is sort of a short term memory
that makes the slower RAM run faster for

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,670
the CPU because the Cache is faster.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,860
You might have an output processor
that generates graphics or

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,200
causes the phone to vibrate or
do other things.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,640
And there might be an input processor,
some media processor

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,330
that takes the video input from a camera,
and the audio input from a microphone.

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,180
And so we can use the same design to
sort of understand how a human works.

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,740
And this is called the model
human processor, and

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,820
it was invented by
Stuart Card back in 1981

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,730
as a way of describing how humans work
to people that work in with computers.

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,670
And so with the model of human processor,
we don't have a CPU,

24
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,070
we have our cognitive processor.

25
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,560
And we don't have a media processor
accepting video input and audio input,

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,170
we have eyes and ears that generate
media in a Visual Image Store and

27
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,730
an Auditory Image Store that is then
processed by a perceptual processor before

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,578
they're processed by
the Cognitive Processor, the brain.

29
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,430
And we don't have cache and RAM, we have
a working memory, and a long term memory.

30
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,630
And we don't have a graphics processor and

31
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,620
something that will vibrate a phone,
we have a motor process for the controls,

32
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,860
how our hands work and for example how
our hands might draw a picture for us.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,130
And in each case these,
each of these processes, memories and

34
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,080
processors have certain decay and
cycle times,

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,890
storage sizes that we can discuss in
the same way that we discuss storage sizes

36
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,010
of random access memory or
the processing time of a processor.

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,910
So first we might look at video
processing, visual processing.

38
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,610
We have an eye, and
the eye takes 230 milliseconds to access.

39
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,170
Meaning we need something from the eye,
we get it about 230 milliseconds later.

40
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,880
And that can vary between up to 70 and
to 700 milliseconds.

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,213
So we can get things as fast as 70
milliseconds from the eye, right?

42
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,565
And then we have a Visual Image Store,
and the size is about 17 and

43
00:02:55,565 --> 00:03:00,100
we're going to talk not necessarily
in terms of bits, bytes or words.

44
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,587
We're going to talk about letters or
chunks.

45
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:06,581
And we can store about 17 things
in our Visual Image Stores, and

46
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:08,860
that depends on what those things are.

47
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,670
And the Visual Image Store is very,
very brief.

48
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,390
It decays in about 200 milliseconds.

49
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,250
And this 200 milliseconds is
our persistence of the vision.

50
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,960
It's the fact that something
can be flashed to our eye.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,940
And our eye remembers what it sees for
about two tenths of a second.

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,310
And that's enough time for
the perceptual processor to catch it.

53
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,587
It's also enough time to do
certain processes like reading.

54
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:37,055
And so when we read it may appear,
when you read the text on the slide,

55
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:41,530
that your eye is moving forward
in a very continuous fashion.

56
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,610
Because it's how we're
processing the information.

57
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,870
And it may seem like we are processing
every letter at a time, but

58
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,390
that's not what's happening.

59
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,770
What happens is we have this Saccades and
our eyes jerking from one location to

60
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,210
another, and we do those very quickly, and
the our eye fixates on a single portion.

61
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,950
And we look at that portion and
the surrounding images on our retina.

62
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,430
And we don't perceive our Saccades.

63
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,212
Our eye is jerking left and
right, and we don't see that.

64
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:12,380
Our perceptual system blanks that
out from our conscience selves.

65
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,980
In terms of reading,
we can read smaller fonts and

66
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,270
larger fonts about at the same rate.

67
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,440
Although larger fonts we
probably feel are easier to read,

68
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,920
we read them at the same rate.

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,010
And we still tend to read printed
pages faster than we read displays.

70
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,600
This text on the right shows that
you're not processing every letter, but

71
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
you're processing letters in chunks, and

72
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,303
we can still read this even though it's
doesn't itself itself really make sense.

73
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,921
There's also audio processing,
and I haven't drawn the ear yet.

74
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:48,950
But you have an ear that sends
signals to an Auditory Image Store.

75
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,430
And again, about five letters of
information, five things of information.

76
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,920
And when you hear something, you have
about a minute and a half to process it.

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,160
So if you're not paying attention to
something, if somebody's talking to you

78
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,280
and you're not paying attention,
and they say, what did I just say?

79
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,430
If they said it in the last one and a half
seconds, then you have a pretty good

80
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,460
chance of being able to recover it,
without even thinking about it.

81
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,930
And so the way that the ear works,
there is an auditory

82
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,720
canal in your ear that focuses sounds
that vibrates in eardrum, that basically

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,230
vibrates some mechanical structures that
then works its way around the cochlea.

84
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,160
That's basically figuring out what
frequency composes the sound and

85
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,220
stimulates the cilia that then
sends signals to the rest of your

86
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,060
perceptual system.

87
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,450
And the sound, there's Pitch,
Loudness, and Timbre.

88
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:52,421
Pitch is the frequency,
where in the cochlea it gets sensed.

89
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:55,381
Loudness is the amplitude of the waveform.

90
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:59,933
And then timbre is the shape of the
waveform, and that can differ based on for

91
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:04,340
example, different instruments
produce different timbres of sound.

92
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,760
We can do stereo location of a source.

93
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,060
We have two ears, and we can do some
stereo location of a source, but

94
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,660
in general it's not very accurate.

95
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,144
The more important thing is we have
a cocktail party effect that means that

96
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,893
we can focus on a particular
conversation and

97
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:24,727
mentally filter out some of
the other noise that's going on and

98
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:28,587
humans still much better than
computers ever have and able to.

99
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:30,600
And finally, Hand-Eye Coordination.

100
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,350
And this pathway's a little
bit more involved.

101
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,800
We have an eye, a Visual Image Store,

102
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,830
that's helping us process
the imagery from the eye.

103
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,960
Then a Perceptual Processor that's
actually doing the processing on the data

104
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,390
in this Visual Image Store.

105
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,440
That gets sent to the brain that
decides what to do with it.

106
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,460
And then the Motor Processor, the hand.

107
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,530
So we've got this Hand-Eye Coordination
that goes through all these paths.

108
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,740
And you can start adding up the time,
230 milliseconds for the eye.

109
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,810
Another 100 milliseconds for
you to perceive what the eye is seeing.

110
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,640
Another 70 seconds for
you to think about the eye.

111
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,458
Then another 70 seconds for your hand to
respond to instructions from your brain.

112
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,950
And so you can use that to
figure out how long it takes for

113
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,850
you to react, or how long it takes for
you to move the mouse.

114
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,282
If I have the mouse in some location,
and I want to move the mouse say to

115
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:27,336
this figure's head, I can figure out how
long it's going to take me to do that.

116
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:31,885
And this is based on several
properties of the human kinesthesis,

117
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,740
the fact that we know where our limbs are.

118
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,870
We know where our fingers
bringing things to.

119
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,690
And also the fact that
larger movements are faster.

120
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,410
I can move the mouse quickly across
the screen and click as well.

121
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,680
I can move the mouse quickly across
the screen, but I do it less accurately.

122
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,120
And so we tend to, when we're finding
a target like if I want to find the center

123
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,680
of the zero and that 70 milliseconds,
I move quickly towards the 0 but

124
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
then I have to do a series of finer and
finer steps.

125
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,210
So we do large lunges followed
by finer and finer refinements.

126
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,020
And so that gives us a logarithmic
rate at which we find things.

127
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,530
And so, if I need to move things farther
than the distance, D gets larger.

128
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,010
But if I need to get to a smaller object,
then the size matters as well.

129
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,129
So I need to divide by the size,
larger things.

130
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:29,739
If I need to point to a larger thing,
it should take me less time, so

131
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:31,520
it's one over the size.

132
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,230
So the distance divided by the size gives
me an indication I can point to the larger

133
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,030
things farther away as fast as I can
point to smaller things closer to me.

134
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,166
And we take the logarithm because the
number of steps I need is based on this

135
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,088
distance over size,
I'm taking shorter and shorter steps.

136
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:54,470
So this is a log base 2.

137
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:00,430
And then we have 240 milliseconds it
takes for each one of those lunges.

138
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,860
240 milliseconds is 70
milliseconds to move your hand,

139
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,920
takes you 100 milliseconds to be able
to see the result of your lunge.

140
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,462
And then another 70 milliseconds to decide
how to correct it with your next lunge.

141
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:19,298
So 70 milliseconds to move the hand,
100 milliseconds to see the result, and

142
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:24,134
then another 70 milliseconds to figure out
what the next Instruction to your hand

143
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:24,910
ought to be.

144
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,030
That's 240 millisecond on average.

145
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,349
And then you need about 600 milliseconds,
six-tenths of a step,

146
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:34,004
just to prepare yourself to
be able to do this exercise.

147
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:38,595
So this is a rough approximation called
Fitt's Law that tells you how quickly it

148
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:41,677
should take you to move
the mouse to a certain region of

149
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:44,710
the screen based on where
the mouse is to begin with.

150
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,750
So what did we learn?

151
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,030
We learned the model human processor,

152
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,330
which describes the human
in terms of a computer.

153
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,780
Which might be more familiar to
some computer science students.

154
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,004
And we can use that model to predict
how a human will perceive data,

155
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:02,505
and react to data.

156
