1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,580
So when we use three dimensional computer
graphics for data visualization.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,740
We need to queue the viewer that they're
looking at a three dimensional scene

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,020
even though they're seeing
a two dimensional image.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,447
That means we need to add three
dimensional perceptional queues to

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,791
an image, but those perceptional queues
can interfere with our perception if three

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,463
dimensions or two dimensions.

7
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:26,980
So we'll learn how we perceive a 3D
world from the two dimensional image on

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,484
our retina and how that ability to
perceive the 3D world can interfere

9
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:35,089
with the visual presentation
of two dimensional data.

10
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:40,880
And what we can do to
avoid that misperception.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,128
So again, we'll look at the visual
part of the model human processor.

12
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:49,932
Basically, our eye is going to be sensing
data that's going to be processed by

13
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:52,320
this perceptual processor.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,390
And as perceptual processor
has been developed to

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,780
understand three dimensional scenes
more that two dimensional scenes.

16
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,546
In particular, perspective.

17
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:05,820
Perspective is a broad word.

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,087
It includes things like foreshortening.

19
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:14,776
The fact that three dimensional objects
are projected onto an image plane or

20
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,715
onto our retinal hemisphere.

21
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:22,710
And that projection creates
foreshortening, so if I look at a unit

22
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,990
cube, when I look at a projection
of the unit cube on an image plane.

23
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,280
Some of the edges
are shorter than the others.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,500
The edges in the depth direction
are going to be shorter than the edges

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,730
in the transverse directions.

26
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,310
And so that's foreshortening,

27
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,910
the effect that this edge is shorter
than this edge in the projection,

28
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,520
even though in the three-dimensional
scene they're the same length.

29
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,693
And so lengths in a projection
are not necessarily accurate compared

30
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:55,778
to the lengths in the real world,
but perceptually we've grown

31
00:01:55,778 --> 00:02:00,505
to understand that these lengths
could be the same length.

32
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:06,004
And the differences are the result of
the projection onto the image plane.

33
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:08,927
And then there's Linear Perspective, and

34
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:13,351
you can see that here we have
a projector which is basically aligned

35
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:17,380
from the object to a focal point
through an image plane here.

36
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:24,207
That's being used by this early
artist in order to create

37
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:29,337
a perspective drawing of this object as a,

38
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:36,150
When we were first understanding
how perspective worked.

39
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,715
Basically, linear perspective said
that object that are further away

40
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:43,462
appears smaller and you can see that here.

41
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,370
And then we have size constancy.

42
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,962
We know that object like this musical
instrument aren't going to change size.

43
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,151
And so
if an object appears to be changing size,

44
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:57,977
it must be moving farther away from us or
closer to us, and

45
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:03,600
that objects that appear smaller than
other objects must be farther away.

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,260
That's a size constancy
expectation we have, and

47
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,570
our perceptual system depends on that.

48
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,490
So it can also malfunction.

49
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,690
And so
here I've got a very simple line drawing.

50
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:22,230
With two parallel lines, A and B,
and then I've got two lines that

51
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,370
are receding in the distance, that are,
kind of sloped against each other.

52
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,458
And these two lines can set up
the appearance of, for example,

53
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:36,970
railroad tracks or
some two lines that are converging to

54
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,629
a vanishing point in
a perspective drawing.

55
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:45,988
And if that's the case, then line A,
if this was a perspective rendering of

56
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:51,629
a three-dimensional scene, line A should
be farther away from us than line B.

57
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:54,160
And if that's the case,
line A should be much bigger.

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,900
And in fact, A looks bigger in
this image because of that.

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,200
But actually line A and
line B are the same size.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,705
But, when we add these additional lines
in here, when we add a perspective

61
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:10,297
context to these lines, line A looks
bigger, because it's farther away.

62
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:18,410
Similarly, I could have two equal
length vertical lines here.

63
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,250
And if I add a few other decorations,
suddenly I've changed the length and

64
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,420
now this line looks shorter and

65
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,500
this line looks taller even though I
know that they are the same length.

66
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,949
After adding these additional lines,
I've decreased the size of this line and

67
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,129
increase the size of
this line perceptually.

68
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:43,927
And the reason is if I follow
these out further I'm thinking of

69
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:49,629
this line in perspective as being
the front corner of a cube.

70
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:54,380
And this line is being the back corner of
for example a room if this is the floor

71
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,921
and the ceiling and this is to the wall
this is the back corner of the room.

72
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:04,249
And this is the closest corner of
an external cube, if that's the case then

73
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:09,577
I would expect this line to be farther
away because it's the back corner and

74
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:14,210
this line to be closer to me,
because it's the front corner.

75
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,180
And in perspective, if I have two lines,
but this line is closer to me, and

76
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,800
this line is farther away, even though
these two lines are the same length,

77
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,000
this one looks bigger,
because it's farther away.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,729
Perspective can also confuse
us just from foreshortening,

79
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,712
not from linear perspectives.

80
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:33,032
So, here I've got a parallelogram, and

81
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:37,474
anytime you have parallel lines that
aren't meeting at ninety degree angles,

82
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:40,700
we expect them to be
receding in other distance.

83
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,769
And so here,
even though this is just a parallelogram,

84
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:49,546
you want it to be a quadrilateral
with right angles or rectangle.

85
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:54,050
That just happens to be receding Into the
distance and that it's being foreshortened

86
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,750
into a parallelogram because it's
being projected on to our retina.

87
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,830
If that as the case, then if this
is receding into the distance,

88
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,250
then the fact that B is closer to
this point than it is to this point,

89
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,620
would make this line
A shorter than line C.

90
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,416
And just looking at the figure it looks
like line AB is shorter than line BC,

91
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:22,588
when in fact line AB and BC are the same
length for this is an isosceles triangle.

92
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:27,890
This also works with texture.

93
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,503
Here I just have
an arrangement of lipsoids,

94
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:33,129
a two dimensional arrangement of lipsoids.

95
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,054
We tend to perceive it as for

96
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:39,421
example the tops of oil barrels
receding off in the distance.

97
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:44,525
Because I've smaller features and
more features in the distance and

98
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:49,717
so I've got a higher frequency of
smaller features in the distance and

99
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:53,336
they lower frequency of
fewer larger features.

100
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:55,161
In the foreground, and

101
00:06:55,161 --> 00:07:00,920
we tend to attribute that to a projection
of linear perspective, as well.

102
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,129
And we also have certain
lighting assumptions.

103
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,880
So we're used to the sun being over head.

104
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,349
And so we're used to objects,
seeing the front sides of objects, and

105
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,172
those objects are illuminated from above.

106
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:19,218
And so we see this dot illuminated
from above as a convex sphere,

107
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:24,264
and we see this dot illuminated
from below with the illumination

108
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:28,296
on the bottom side as being
a concave indentation.

109
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:31,147
Because we don't expect illumination
to come from the bottom,

110
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,740
we expect illumination
to come from the top.

111
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,702
And the only way for this to be
illuminated from the top like this,

112
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:42,046
is if it was an indentation instead of
a bulge, as it is on the left side.

113
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:47,201
So when we use three dimensional graphics
for data visualization, our perception

114
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:52,160
of size is based on our perception of
how far the object is away from us.

115
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,310
And that can sometimes mislead us to
what the actual size of the object is.

116
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,017
So we want to avoid using
three-dimensional computer graphics for

117
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:05,254
data visualization when we can, and only
use it when it's absolutely necessary.

118
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:18,086
