  Data Visualization Syllabus
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Course Description
 </h2>
 <p>
  Data Visualization is a course that teaches how to create visualizations that effectively communicate the meaning behind data to an observer through visual perception. We will learn how a computer displays information using computer graphics, and how the human perceives that information visually. We will also study the forms of data, including quantitative and non-quantitative data, and how they are properly mapped to the elements of a visualization to be perceived well by the observer. We will briefly overview some design elements for effective visualization, though we will not focus on the visual design needed to make attractive and artistic visualizations. This course does not require computer programming, but computer programming can be used to complete the exercises. The course will conclude with the integration of visualization into database and data-mining systems to provide support for decision making, and the effective construction of a visualization dashboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am continually looking to improve this course and may encounter some issues requiring us to make changes sooner rather than later. As such, this syllabus is subject to change. I appreciate your input and ask that you have patience as we make adjustments to this course.

  Elements of This Course
 </h2>
 <p>
  The course is comprised of the following elements:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Lecture videos.
    </strong>
    In each module the concepts you need to know will be presented through a collection of short video lectures. You may stream these videos for playback within the browser by clicking on their titles or download the videos. You may also download the slides that go along with the videos.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Quizzes.
    </strong>
    Week 1 and Week 4 will include a for-credit quiz. You will be allowed 3 attempts at the quiz per every 8 hours. Each attempt may present a different selection of questions to you. Your best score will be used when calculating your final score in the class. There is no time limit on how long you take to complete each attempt at the quiz.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Programming assignments.
    </strong>
    There are two required programming assignments for the class. The first programming assignment is to create a visualization of numerical data, and the second programming assignment is to create a visualization of non-numerical data (e.g., a network or a hierarchy). For each assignment, sample data will be provided, but you are encouraged to find your own data. Your goal will be to present that data in a visualization that helps the observer to better understand what the data represents. The programming assignments will be peer graded based on rubrics that measure how well the course's methods have been applied to the visualization of the data.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
