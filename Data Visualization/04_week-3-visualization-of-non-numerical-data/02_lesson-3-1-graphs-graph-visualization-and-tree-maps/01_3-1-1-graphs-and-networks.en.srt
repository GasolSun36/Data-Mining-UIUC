2
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:12,201
So for handling non-coordinate data,
non-numerical data,

3
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:15,807
we're often more interested in
the relationship between data

4
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,740
items than in the data items themselves.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,830
And so we'll use a graph or

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,060
a network to represent
the relationships between data items.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,520
And so we'll talk here about different
ways of specifying a graph, and

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,520
different attributes of graphs, and how
graphs are represented computationally.

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,470
So a graph just consists of nodes and
edges.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,530
In this case, we have four nodes and
we have five edges connecting these nodes.

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,420
And so
the nodes will represent a data item and

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,600
the edge will represent
a relationship between two data items.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,870
If we add this particular edge,

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,930
then every data item is going to be
connected to every other data item.

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,190
We would call that a complete graph,
or a clique, of these four nodes.

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,940
Here on the left, I've got I've got
a graph of four nodes connected by

17
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,340
five edges, and on the right I've got
four nodes connected by five edges.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,330
In fact, these two graphs are isomorphic.

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,940
They're the same graph,
they're just laid out differently.

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,959
And on the right, I've got a planar graph,
which means to nodes and

21
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:29,570
edges are laid out so
that none of the edges cross each other.

22
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,545
And then I can speak of a face
as being the region bounded

23
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:39,641
by a cycle of edges starting and
ending at the same node.

24
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:45,070
And also, we would say that these
are two different embeddings

25
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,890
of the same graph or
at least these graphs are isomorphic.

26
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,440
If we think of this whole
arrangement of eight nodes and

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,520
ten edges as a single graph,

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,350
then that would be one graph consisting
of two connected components, but

29
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,289
the entire graph containing both of these
sub graphs would be a disconnected graph.

30
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,940
We can also have directed graphs.

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,750
So in an ordinary graph,
or an undirected graph,

32
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,670
just has edges, but does not really
suggest the direction of these edges.

33
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,530
We can have a directed graph by using
arrows to indicate a direction, so

34
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,770
that we would have a connection
from this node to this node, but

35
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,060
not necessarily a connection from
this node back to this node.

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,580
And you can think of a graph as having a
cycle, a directed graph having a cycle, so

37
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,040
this undirected graph, this ordinary graph
has a cycle because these three nodes.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,590
I can start at this node and
I can follow the cycle to get back.

39
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,200
You can have a cyclic directed graph,
because I can follow a cycle here.

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,760
This graph is acyclic,
because there is no cycle.

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,830
Once I get to this node
I can go to this node.

42
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,540
Once I get to this node,
I can't go any place further.

43
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,190
So there's no way to get
back to any of these nodes

44
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,390
by following these edges in
the directions indicated.

45
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,740
You can also have trees.

46
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,740
Any graph that's connected

47
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,650
that has one less edge than
the number of nodes forms a tree.

48
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,624
It's minimally connected.

49
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:20,191
And you can think of having a parent node,
but for an undirected graph,

50
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:25,770
any of these nodes could be the parent and
you can think of multiple siblings.

51
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,760
Here's some graphs with
many more edges and

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,000
you can see kind of the way they're
laid out would imply a parent.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,920
But I could lay these out
in isomorphic methods,

54
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,100
equivalent methods, and another potent
node might appear to be the parent.

55
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,020
When you have directed graphs,
the tree forms a hierarchy and

56
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,480
then you can have a parent.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,880
So in this case, the child nodes,
these child nodes point to their parents.

58
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,230
And so I've plotted their parents
higher than the child nodes.

59
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,910
And then there is a clear root node.

60
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,220
This one parent that's the parent
of all of these nodes.

61
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,330
You can also have a hierarchy
that's not a tree.

62
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,740
In this case we have
a parent relationship,

63
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,690
but this child node has two parents.

64
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,220
And so
you've got a definite hierarchy here, but

65
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,550
it's not a tree because a tree would have
each node would have a single parent node.

66
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,310
There's also a relationship between

67
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,910
the number of edges each node has and
the kind of graph you're looking at.

68
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,250
We talk about the degree of the node
as being the number of edges

69
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,250
extending from a node.

70
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,530
Directed graphs would have a different
in degree than an out degree.

71
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,450
The in degree would be the number
of edges going into the node and

72
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,920
the out degree would be the number
of edges leaving the node.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,770
And then these, the number of
nodes you have of each degree,

74
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,270
if it follows this kind of fall off,
it's called a social network.

75
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,927
A social network, you can think
of this as a friend's network or

76
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:06,250
many natural

77
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,210
data relationships follow this power law,
this social network power law.

78
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,470
In this case, this is the number
of interactions of yeast proteins.

79
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,570
Each one of these nodes
is a yeast protein, and

80
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,460
the edges represent interaction between
these proteins and, in this case,

81
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,590
you have many nodes that have a few
interactions that are connected to,

82
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,480
you know, one or two,
you have one or two edges.

83
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,270
And then you have many fewer nodes that
have high degree, that have a lot of edges

84
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,830
that are connected to a lot of
other nodes by a single edge.

85
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,808
And so in this case, the number of
nodes that have a certain degree

86
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:49,160
follows a power-law.

87
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,503
If the y is the number of
nodes with that degree,

88
00:05:53,503 --> 00:06:00,143
is equal to the degree to some power
with some constant multiplied to it.

89
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:05,030
And you see this fall
off happen quite often.

90
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,350
These graphs tend not to be plainer,
they tend to be difficult to embed.

91
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,930
They also tend to be the most popular
graphs that we encounter in real life.

92
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,720
Finally, we're going to use an adjacency
matrix to represent graphs.

93
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,560
And so in this case we have a graph
that has four nodes, four data items.

94
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,640
One, two, three and four,

95
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,850
and then we're going to represent
this graph using this matrix.

96
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:38,190
In this case, the Adjacency Matrix
will have a one in row one,

97
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,680
column two, if there's an edge
connecting node one to node two.

98
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,370
Likewise, it'll have a one in row two,
column one,

99
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,960
because it connects node two to node
one and so it will be symmetric.

100
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,090
Because this is a non-directed graph.

101
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,240
If it was a directed graph, then you
would connect, if it was directed from

102
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,040
node one to node two by an edge
leaving node one going to node two.

103
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,820
Then you would have a one
in row one column two but

104
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,880
you would have a zero
in row two column one.

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,940
So a directed graph
would have asymmetric or

106
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,771
could have an asymmetric adjacency
matrix but an ordinary graph,

107
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:26,665
a non-directed graph, would just
have a symmetric adjacency matrix.

108
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:28,775
And these edges could also have weights,

109
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:32,945
in which case you might not just have
zero or one, you might have a value here

110
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:37,060
to indicate how strong
the connection is between nodes.

111
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,810
And the diagonal is usually zero, unless
there's some relationship between a node

112
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,490
and itself, and
you can represent that along the diagonal.

113
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:50,860
So it might be good to review graphs and
the different kinds of graphs,

114
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,006
the different representations of graphs,
and

115
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:58,801
the different attributes of graphs
to familiarize yourself with them,

116
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:02,668
because we'll be using those for
the rest of this module.

117
