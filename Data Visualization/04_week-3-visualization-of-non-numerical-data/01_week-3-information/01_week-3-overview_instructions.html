  Week 3: Visualization of Non-Numerical Data
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  During this week's module, you will learn how to visualize graphs that depict relationships between data items. You'll also plot data using coordinates that are not specifically provided by the data set.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Time
 </h2>
 <p>
  This module should take
  <strong>
   approximately 6-7 hours
  </strong>
  of dedicated time to complete, with its videos and assignments.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Visualize graphs that depict relationships between data items.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Layout data using coordinates that are not explicitly provided by the data.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while completing the readings and working on assignments throughout the week.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Is there any data you encounter that is difficult to plot because it lacks appropriate coordinates?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Is it because the data has too many dimensions?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Or is it because the interesting details are in the data points themselves?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Or is it the relationship between data points?
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h2 level="2">
  Key Phrases and Concepts
 </h2>
 <p>
  Keep your eyes open for the following key terms or phrases as you complete the readings and interact with the lectures. These topics will help you better understand the content in this module.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Graphs, especially different kinds of graphs (e.g., directed v. undirected), ways to represent graphs (e.g., adjacency matrix), and the associated terms (e.g., node degree)
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  NOTE: Don't worry if you do not have experience with linear algebra and some of the other concepts used in the slides. Terms like linear system, eigenvector, and optimization describe the tools we use in visualization. While I am trying to provide the details of those tools to the students who may be interested in them, understanding those details is not going to be required to complete the course, and we will provide implementations of those tools that you can simply use as a black box if needed. In any event, it will be good for everyone to be exposed to the math and computation needed to produce good coordinates to plot data when it does not already contain good coordinates.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Social networks and centrality metrics
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Treemaps, word clouds, cartograms, and choropleths
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this week, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
