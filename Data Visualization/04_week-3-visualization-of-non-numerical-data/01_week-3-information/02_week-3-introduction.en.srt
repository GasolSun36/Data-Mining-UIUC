1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,430
So in module three,
we're going to be visualizing data that

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,406
doesn't have coordinates
associated with it explicitly.

3
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:18,780
That means we're going to have to
derive the coordinates from the data,

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,180
through analysis, through mathematics,
and specifically through linear algebra.

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,160
So if you don't have experience
with linear algebra, don't worry.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,762
I'm going to be going into a lot of
details involving linear algebra and

7
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:34,927
other mathematical techniques for
people that understand those techniques so

8
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:37,238
that they can implement these algorithms.

9
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,690
But if you don't have experience
with those techniques,

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,697
with this area of mathematics,
that's fine.

11
00:00:41,697 --> 00:00:43,043
We're not going to be quizzed on it.

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,263
You're not going to be
required to implement it for

13
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:46,841
the project at the end of the week.

14
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:51,856
We have tools that will provide that for
you, so just bear with us.

15
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:56,426
And you'll get an appreciation for
the tools that are used to

16
00:00:56,426 --> 00:01:01,005
lay out data when we don't have
coordinates assigned to it.

17
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:10,747
