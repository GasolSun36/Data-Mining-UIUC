2
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:13,381
So in our previous discussions,
we've been focusing on the relationship

3
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:17,610
between data points, where we're
plotting the data points as points.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,310
In some cases, you want to display more
than just points, you want to display

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,760
shapes to represent the data, and in that
case you want to pack the shapes together.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,236
So here's an example called a word cloud,
and this is basically the overview

7
00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:36,884
text from our data visualization
course from the Coursera page.

8
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:42,324
And I've just passed this through
a web page called Wordle.net and

9
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:48,433
it created this word cloud which
basically displays the most common words,

10
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:54,850
the words that are distinctive that
aren't everyday words like the, and and.

11
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,670
And words that are used multiple
times get displayed larger than

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,540
the words that are smaller.

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,280
And then there's a process that
packs these words into a collection,

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,450
so instead of just displaying
the words in order horizontally

15
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,669
that you might see in a tag cloud,
this word cloud is packed together.

16
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:21,250
And there is a spiral
algorithm that it uses

17
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,560
to basically find a first open
space to pack a new word in it.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,750
Tries to start with the largest words
first and then packs in the small ones

19
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:34,210
later based on that same spiral trial and
error techniques spiraling out from

20
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:40,111
the middle to try to pack the words into
the location that they'll fit into first.

21
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:43,818
And so these techniques tend
to use area as a measure, and

22
00:01:43,818 --> 00:01:46,611
we've looked at area as a measure before.

23
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:52,210
It's a pretty good quantitative measure,
but ordinal, it's not very good.

24
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,380
Being able to tell whether two different
shapes have the same area can be quite

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,000
difficult.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,131
So if you have consistent shapes.

27
00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:02,885
It's hard to tell if I have the same
amount of area in the blue circle as in

28
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,860
this orange square.

29
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,809
But if you have consistent shapes,
if I have two circles,

30
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:13,011
then I can tell that the areas
are the same based on the length.

31
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:17,843
And then if the shapes are aligned,
if they share the same base,

32
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:22,584
then I can just look at the height
at the position, at the top and

33
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:27,264
tell if the orange circle is less
than the blue circle in area.

34
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:30,519
And so area is very difficult
to determine, especially

35
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,300
when you have inconsistent shapes, but
becomes useful if you have consistent and

36
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,465
aligned shapes, because then you're
using actual length and position.

37
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:44,760
Also area, as the area increases or
decreases,

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,470
the length is going to increase or
decrease as the square root of the area,

39
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,760
and so that also complicates figuring out
a quantitative difference between shapes.

40
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,270
And so, if we want to plot a bunch of data
without any coordinates attached to it,

41
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,340
you could just pack the data
together using, for example,

42
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,880
area to display the data.

43
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,700
So this is a Tableau plot
of the population from our

44
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,320
WDI database, and
you can see some of the larger

45
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,010
items are labeled if the label
will fit in the region, but

46
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:28,540
here the area is basically indicating
population, total number of people.

47
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,497
The area is proportional
to the number of people.

48
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:36,224
And because these are all the same
shape we can do a pretty good job of

49
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:37,750
finding an ordinal.

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,988
I can tell that China has
more people than India.

51
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:42,286
India has more people than United States.

52
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:47,185
United States has more people than Brazi,
and so on.

53
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:51,646
And so we get a good indication,
at least an ordinal indication,

54
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:56,350
of the differences in population,
and we don't need to use any other

55
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,840
coordinates because we're we're just
comparing the areas to each other.

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,448
We're not plotting anything
horizontally or vertically,

57
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:07,936
we're just using the horizontal and
vertical axis to keep our shapes disjoint.

58
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:15,411
So another way of plotting
things horizontally or

59
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:19,838
vertically is to display them on a map,
and in this case,

60
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:23,270
we've distorted the map into a cartogram.

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,537
Here's an ordinary atlas of the world,
and here's that same atlas

62
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:34,655
distorted based on population, so
that the amount of distortion,

63
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:39,079
the area of the region is
proportional to its population.

64
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,614
And you can see that certain regions have
grown larger than they were before, and

65
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:46,290
certain regions have
grown to be much smaller.

66
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:52,700
There's not very many people in Siberia,
and so that's very small given it's area.

67
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,710
India and China have a lot of population,

68
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,580
high population density, and so
their regions have grown much larger.

69
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,370
In Africa you can see that Nigeria
has grown to be quite large.

70
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,311
And so
this is a a way of indicating with area,

71
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:15,748
certain data that you
would want to visualize.

72
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,280
Again, it's relative.

73
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:25,470
It would be difficult to tell ordinally
if the there's more people in for

74
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,159
example, France or Germany, based on this
display because the shapes are different,

75
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,860
and it's difficult to judge area
relationships between different shapes,

76
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,525
but we can certainly tell that
Germany is is roughly the same

77
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:43,585
shape it's just grown larger with a little
bit of distortion than it was before.

78
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:46,705
And so that's the distinction we're
trying to make with the cartogram.

79
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:51,015
So how do you create those cartograms?

80
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:54,948
Well you start, in this case,
with a grid of density data.

81
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:56,860
And this is an old algorithm for
doing this.

82
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,615
There's better techniques that
are more sophisticated but

83
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:00,970
also much more complicated.

84
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,383
This is a nice way to do it.

85
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:09,410
If you just fill a grid in with
density data such as your local

86
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:16,170
population density so within some unit
area, what is the population density?

87
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,468
And so it could be heavily
populated in this area and

88
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:22,670
lightly populated in these areas.

89
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,030
And so you create a grid like
that of rectangular cells and

90
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,940
then you just scale each
cell by that density value.

91
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,793
So the squares that have
a population density

92
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:40,783
of one-half get shrunk
by one-half in area.

93
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,730
So that's about 70% horizontally and
vertically.

94
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,297
The areas that have population
density one stay the same size, and

95
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:51,629
the areas that have larger population
densities would grow proportionally, so

96
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:56,107
these squares would become twice as big,
these squares become three times as big.

97
00:06:56,107 --> 00:07:01,750
And then you can see that what we had as
a grid before now becomes disconnected.

98
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,880
And so to reconnect it, we want to
reconnect these corners to their average

99
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,420
of the four corners that
shared that corner.

100
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,400
So we want to find a new point for

101
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,390
this corner equal to the average of
these four previous corner points.

102
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,352
So we create a new set
of grid vertices equal

103
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:23,892
to the average of the four grid
vertices that shared them before.

104
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:27,890
Or three or two depending on, or
one, if you're on the perimeter.

105
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,729
And so we create this new grid and
this new grid is deformed.

106
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:36,113
And so based on this deformed grid
We keep iterating that over and

107
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:39,116
over until we get a final deformed grid,
and

108
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:43,742
then we look at the differences
between the original grid points and

109
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:48,470
their new positions in the deformed
grid that sets up a deformation.

110
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,146
It basically tells us what direction
we should move data points.

111
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:57,619
Then, we take our shape vertices of
the outline data of our original map and

112
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:01,666
deform them based on these arrows,
and we can smoothly interpolate

113
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:06,140
these arrows if we need in between
values in order to create the cartogram.

114
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,172
Its basically,

115
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:11,965
we take a vector graphics representation
of our data of our map and then deform

116
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:16,790
the vertices based on this type of
deformation to create the cartogram.

117
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,826
So another technique that might be
better than a cartogram is the ordinary

118
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:23,638
choropleth, and
we see choropleths all the time.

119
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:28,350
It's basically data that's
plotted over regions of a map.

120
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,179
This is that same population data but

121
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:35,386
plotted inside the original
outlines of our regions.

122
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:41,097
In here, population is Is just given
by the saturation of the color,

123
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:44,740
and when we're looking at ordinal values,

124
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,450
basically we can see that China has
more population than India does,

125
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:57,650
has more population than the U.S., which
has more population than Brazil and so on.

126
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:03,710
So you get a better indication of the
order of these things from a chloropleth

127
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,772
than you might with a cardogram because
area is such a poor indicator order,

128
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:15,455
whereas density saturation hue,
density being intensity of a color or

129
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:20,120
saturation in hue,
are much better indicators of order.

130
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:26,397
So there's several techniques now for
plotting data without using coordinate

131
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:28,940
data associated with the data for
it's layout.

132
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,240
We're deriving coordinate data.

133
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,300
In these most recent examples we are using
geographical data, where we have maybe

134
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,210
a region name, or a country name, and then
we're deriving the actual coordinates of

135
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:45,470
that, perhaps an outline to fill in,
or a location on a map to generate.

136
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,390
Or we're using some other packing or
layout algorithm to distribute the data.

137
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:54,550
Those are all useful techniques in In the
case where you've got data that you don't

138
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,726
want to use the explicit coordinates in
the data as coordinates for their display.
